I can’t have my grandmother over for the holidays, but Lightfoot can mingle with as many activists and ANTIFA members as she wants?

Governor Pritzker has got to be one of the worst offenders. In the midst of the rigid shutdowns he  enforced last spring, Pritzker took a trip to Florida to escape his own mandates, all while ordering Illinois citizens to remain within state borders. Not only that, but another family member of mine spotted Pritzker unmasked in a crowded restaurant in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The rules must not apply to him I guess.

“Do as I say, not as I do,” is a mindset that has never been more prevalent among our politicians. It is not only limited to those who govern my home state, but to other political figures such as Pelosi and Cuomo who refuse to practice what they preach. When will these tyrants learn that they are not above the law? When will they learn that they are not exempt from their own orders? 

Anyways, I better get back to work—oh wait—I can’t. I forgot that I haven’t worked in weeks since Pritzker shut down the state again. Oh well. I hope he has fun in Florida.",0

4,12,1306,242,"So I got a lot of things to say about this election So Biden wins, but it’s obvious that things don’t end here. I personally think that the media is saying that he wins to get our hopes down, and so far, they’re doing a good job. But there is still a lot of stuff that is about to go down before anyone’s becomes president. The amount of voter fraud and cheating is astronomical. Recounts obviously need to happen and we need to make this an honest election again. So no, I don’t think the whole election stuff is over yet, and neither should you.

A good example of all of this voter fraud  is the recent computer “glitch” in  Michigan that caused it to go blue. The glitch was that votes that were supposed to go for trump actually went for Biden instead. Many other counties and states used the same computer system that Michigan used, so now I wonder how many other fake votes there possibly could be. (And that glitch was obviously not a coincidence) 

Personally, if we do end up doing recounts and Biden still wins, I’ll be fine with that because America honestly elected him. But that hasn’t happened yet, so until it does, I won’t be satisfied that Biden has really won. Sorry about the rant, I’m just confused that Biden actually won, and I still have a bunch of questions that I want answers to.",0

2,14,929,159,"Question about validity of USPS Michigan whistleblower and Project Veritas I read through the report, but I try to do my own research on these things to confirm.

What does not make sense to me, is according to the report, the whistleblower stated:

""he was instructed by a direct supervisor Jonathan Clarke to separate late ballots found in mail-boxes and “hand stamp them with the previous day’s date.”  

This supposedly happened on the 4th, and he was told to stamp them with 11/3/2020 as their postal date.

However, according to the my research, the Michigan Court of appeals ruled on Oct 16th, 2020, that:

""Ballots received after 8 p.m. on Election Day in Michigan cannot be counted, an appeals court ruled on Friday""

So the whole story as reported by Project Vertias seems suspect as the backdating would not result in past due ballets being allowed to be counted, at least according to Michigan state law.

R/trump is banning anyone who claims there is vote fraud yet nobody was banned when democrats where they were saying Russia intervened in the elections with zero evidence supporting that. 

If Biden wins it, the mainstream media and social media censoring will most likely double up. Meaning you will never see the media criticize Biden nor give him the same attention that trump used to have 24/7. Anyone who talks shit about Biden will get his account banned for “misinformation”. Itnwill start to feel like you live in a Soviet Russia or Nazi germany where only one sort of thinking is accepted. 

We are entering an era of a police state and fascism where only left leaning thoughts and beliefs are allowed. 

I am proud that right leaning thinkers from all over the world are mature enough not to cause riots even though the media undermines our intelligence 24/7 even though our ideals have proven time and time again to improve lives.

But here's the thing: what if it was just time for the party to pass the gavel? I think it's a reasonable, good-faith question to ask. 

The conclusion I finally came to when asked this question was ""yes, time to pass it to someone else"", for a couple reasons:

* The party has evolved over the past 20 years, arguably more than Pelosi's positions. I don't think she can represent the whole party as well as others can (James Cliburn, Connor Lamb, etc etc) 

* She's become permanently marked by conservative media. I don't like that fact, but its patently true. Maybe it's time we start a new chapter with a clean slate agenda in the house. 

* She's going to have to retire as Speaker at some point. That's a fact, she can't live forever. I wonder why not just take this moment and allow the party to start totally anew, as a form or pseudo-reconstruction? 

* There are qualified candidates to hold the gavel. Pelosi is not the *only* qualified House member to serve as Speaker. 

I'm not violently-*for* this, but we must consider it. It is incumbent upon us to consider it.",1

3,4,1287,223,"A postmortem report on the Florida Democratic Party – Mondoweiss The Florida Democratic Party needs change.  It's too important a state to just let it turn red, especially if reports are correct and we'll be adding an additional US House seat after the 2020 census report is finalized.

Fellow Florida Democrats, 2022 is our last stand. We absolutely must remove DeSantis and Rubio, but that won't happen until we reevaluate the effectiveness of the FDP.  We don't even have to start from scratch - our neighbors just north of us showed us a map of how important grass roots organizing will beat money every time.  Here we had specific counties focused on outreach without the state wide party support, and we were able to flip 3 of of them: For Seminole County, it was the first time they voted for Democratic candidate in a Presidential campaign *since 1948*. For Duval county, it was the first time since 1976 that it voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate. Pinellas County was won by only 1,300 votes.   Again this was done *without* the support of the statewide party's resources.    


I am happy other states stepped up to ensure Trump's removal in the Presidential office, but here we got destroyed.  We have a uphill climb over the next 2 years - its time to get to work.",1

This is also why he is interfering in the transition. 
  
Looking at the exponential rise of infections happening right now no matter what Biden does to stop it it is almost guaranteed more people will die under Bidens first 4 years than under the last year of the Trump presidency.
  
Republicans will use this fact to state accurately that, ""More Americans died under Biden than under Trump."" While falsely claiming that Trump had it under control and it was ""rounding the corner"" as Trump likes to repeat constantly.
  
This is the same logic they use to claim Trump fixed the economy after 8 years under Obama.",1

5,0,2683,477,"Defense Against the Dark Arts I think Democrats need a Defense Against the Dark Arts class. It's high time. We've been hoodwinked over and over again by underhanded tricks, but many of them are actually quite obvious when you know what to look for. Here's just one of many examples.

# Republicans Accuse Their Opposition of The Bad Thing They Themselves Intend to Do

This one is as effective as it is obvious. And you've seen it happen right under your nose many, many times. The most recent example is the Trump administration's accusation of voter fraud. In all caps they will scream THE RADICAL LEFT IS BURNING VOTES AND THE AMERICAN FLAG!!

When as we know the Trump Administration tried to do everything within it's power to suppress the vote. Trump literally installed his patsy as the head of the post office and sabotaged mail sorting machines. Just one item in a long list of ways they have tried to, well, burn votes and the American flag.

We can squabble over minor semantic differences (voter suppression vs. voter fraud), but that misses the larger point. Republicans knowingly, intentionally, and in broad daylight have tried to stop people from voting for Democrats by hook or by crook, for years.

So this is a perfect example of the rule. Republicans, by accusing Democrats of the bad thing they themselves intend to do, have distracted all attention from the bad thing they did.

Part of it is rhetorical. If you call someone a poop head, and they just call you a poop head right back, the second person who said it sounds unoriginal. ""No YOU'RE the poop head! Poop head!"" So by preemptively accusing the opposition, they've taken that card out of play.

Part of it is the news cycle. News outlets can only write so many stories a week about one topic. So Republicans can beat us to the punch and burn up all the available news cycles by falsely accusing Democrats of voter fraud. 

Even if their accusations are proven false, or even ignored, they still win. Why? Because now when we discover they have actually committed voter fraud themselves, the news has already covered that story too much, and they have to write about other things or they will lose readers.

I don't want to belabor the point too much, because I think if you think about it you probably know that this is true. But I think many Democrats don't see this kind of stuff, basically because we're nice and a little naive -- not in a bad way, but our niceness just blinds us a little bit to nefarious things.

Anyway, I hope this is useful and doesn't upset anyone. I basically just see a lot of dirty tricks being played against my side and I want to point them out.

18,21,3109,569,"I grew up before fake news I'm 56, when I was young and infinitely more persuadable than I am today, there was really no such thing as fake news. There was the National Enquirer and the sort but it was well understood by almost everyone that those were not to be taken seriously. Our local newspapers only covered local news so the only source of national or world events was delivered into our living room every evening by Walter Cronkite, ""That's the way it is"". And that's the way it was. He was the most trusted man in America because he didn't tell lies. Fox news didn't even come onto the scene until I was in my 30's and the first time I heard them I remember thinking that the soup tasted funny. I began to Understand that Paul Harvey was politically slanted  even though he sounded like a responsible commentator but his program was called ""news and commentary"" so it seem justified. 

My point is that I think growing up with 3 network news sources (ABC, NBC, and CBS) that were committed to responsible journalism helped give me a built in bullshit meter and when I hear news that is clearly politically slanted one way or another, I can tell. I may not always be able to define it but I know it when I see it.  Look, I'm not saying that the big 3 always did a great job of informing us of America's intentions overseas but they weren't bending the truth to the benefit of one political party or the other. 

I know from speaking to young people today that they have a really hard time discerning the difference between credible news and news stories with an agenda. Almost every day I am explaining to someone that a sensational news story that they read in their news feed is not true and how I can tell that it's not true. The belief that all the media is as credible as any of it, is pretty common. I was told by a young man that ""the media just lies to you all the time"" and his friends enthusiastically agreed. I told them that it was important to read reputable news sources so that you could tell the difference between news and commentary. NPR, BBC, The New York Times, they looked at me like I was from another dimension. 

This is a problem. This might be the problem. An enormous segment of the population has no bullshit meter. To make matters worth, the people producing irresponsible content are openly attacking credible journalism and calling it fake news. We are living in an age of misinformation. Politically motivated content has worked to not only move the argument farther to the right  but it has also corrupted peoples' abilities to know what to believe. 

This needs to be addressed by our public education system. I think that there is a propensity to be very cautious around First Amendment rights in school and I understand that determining what is credible news or not shouldn't be determined by our government, but I think that there is a way to teach some type of critical thinking on the matter and that if we don't we will soon live in a world where an even larger segment of the population thinks that the ""truth"" is a personal choice. 

And that's the way it is.",1

Stop telling such outlandish tales. Stop turning minnows into whales.

Now, what can I say When I get home today?

All along the way to work And all the way back, I’ve looked up results And I’ve kept careful track But all that I’ve noticed Except a defeat Was a sad man refusing To say he’d been beat.

That’s nothing to tell of, That won’t do because, That’s all this man knows Lying is all he does.

That can’t be my story. That’s only a beginning Let’s say “this is just the first inning!” That will suck in supporters like an endless buffet When I say it happened here in the USA

Yes, the threat is fine But it has no teeth We need to tell of fraud all around, like a bad Christmas wreath. On states he’s ahead, like in Pennsylvania Shout “STOP THE COUNT” as if it were mania In states he’s behind though That simply won’t do We need to “Count those votes” Count them all, through and through.

Yes, that will impress the rabid followers today Especially when we tell them, this is the USA

But shouting about counting will only last so long We need to come up with something to continue, prolong What if we said that dead people had voted? That’ll shock them right in their rump Oh wait…those dead people voted for Trump.

We need to find a way to keep the evidence from escaping We’ll have a big conference at the Four Seasons! Total Landsacaping There, we’ll tell the people about voters from Mars MeepThorp Xandar voted from the stars They’ll totally believe that, it’s the only way Especially when we tell them, this is the USA

But that’s not really going to work is it? Let’s just sue everyone and try to elicit A response a judgement, anything in our favor We’re not giving up! We’ll never quaver!

OK, I’ve GOT IT, the voting machines were hacked! I’ve got it on good authority, Indeed it’s a fact! My cousin’s husband’s sister told me it’s true I have proof, I tell ya, this is a breakthrough!

He won

Someone I know read some pop article which had an anti-liberal bias, but he's lost it so I couldn't reference it. The summary was that due to the rise in home break-ins post-election, especially in California, people who didn't have guns are now trying to buy them, but are getting tripped up by the gun control legislation- apparently most of them didn't realize how long the process takes and- so the article said- are complaining loudly. The article assumes they're mostly or all liberals who voted for gun control laws without educating themselves first. I do wonder how someone could assume political leanings based on the run on guns and complaints? 

I vote by issue, not party, and voted more to get Trump out than Biden in, for example. I'm not sure how liberals usually break down as a group on guns and gun control, and how much they usually know about the process of buying. I specifically don't know about the process in California and which political group is more for the current laws or not. But I have met plenty of conservatives who vote without knowing the details of gun control and assumptions bother me.

Does anyone care to discuss and educate me?",1

I believe that we’re all entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness regardless of skin color, gender, sexual orientation etc. politics creates a divide. Almost like a mini civil war. Your neighbor doesn’t believe what you do? Fuck them they’re a dirty hippie or they’re a scumbag fascist. You want steps of how to change things? Here:

1) abolish the federal reserve. It’s as federal as FedEx. Put us back on the gold standard. Fuck even do Bitcoin these days. 

2) unemployment and disability insurance is a guaranteed payout based on what you’ve paid into it. If you use it all, you’re finished. 

3) social security has no gains. The money paid into it is used by the federal government. It’s basically a bond that has dimishing returns. All payments should be consolidated into a mutual fund that would further stimulate the economy and produce returns to compensate for at least inflation for all those that have paid into it. 

4) Income tax is theft. It is, In Essence, taxation without representation. There is no law that says you have to pay taxes. But there is legislation that says if you don’t, your assets may be seized by the IRS which is funded by the assets seized and the surplus goes to the federal government. All taxes should be kept locally in the economy. We don’t need, nor deserve, to pay Uncle Sam for protection. We have the right to form militiae and to bear arms in protection of our own. 

5) marriage between anybody is legalized. Anything other is an affront to the ideals that all are created equal. Taking a stance against a group is saying that they are lesser than human and we know what that leads to. Just look at the whites shouting n****r across all regions. 

6) shrink the federal government. Increase the power of the local government. Keep funds within the province. Reduce as far as possible. You don’t want your podunk money going to the big city in your state. 

7) abolish the electoral college and set term limits for the senate and House of Representatives as well as the Supreme Court. 

8) TAKE CORPORATE INTERESTS AND LOBBYING OUT OF GOVERNMENT! Candidates should be selected by the people and run for the people. Do not allow corporate funding for campaigning nor the selection on candidates by convention. This is what robs us of our freedom of choice. 

9) a small portion of your income is ‘donated’ to welfare services which include mental health care, food stamps, and general assistance for those who need it in your district. All money is kept locally and time limits are strict in these all the while the recipients are trained to find careers suitable to thrive and get off of public assistance. 

10) local local local. The federal government is bloated and egotistical. Keep money within a community and grow it and take care of your own. The federal government is nothing more than a siphon off of the prosperity of a region. Making its gains off the the populous to use in way which they deem suitable. The federal government should be small and have one purpose. To speak for its citizens. 

Until this is done we will never know true prosperity and we only dig our graves deeper toward 1984",2

1,27,4927,852,"The US Tax Code is a hot mess Guys, seriously.  What the hell is going on with the tax code in the USA??  It's bad enough that I have to pay so much tax, but I shouldn't need an accountant to calculate and report taxes.  But increasingly, I'm beginning to feel I have no other choice.

I seriously had assumed that all ETFs were just like stocks, traded and taxed at the usual rate.  But alas, they are not.  Recently, I discovered that if you own foreign ETFs they get classified as ""passive income foreign corporations"" and are therefore taxed by a bizarre and completely different method.  Specifically all gains are taxed at the maximum federal income tax rate (regardless of how what tax bracket you fall into).  Additionally you are charged interest over the holding period that the gains occurred and the cost basis is calculated completely differently.  Calculations sound like a moderate pain in the ass, but the IRS itself estimates that doing the forms associated with this sort of transaction ""typically"" takes 40 hours or more.  Gains are split into a rainbow of smaller and smaller portions, each taxed at different rates, with different ""virtual"" holding periods and tax treatments.  I literally couldn't believe how complicated this shit is.  ""This must be a joke"" I thought, but the more I read, the more my disbelief morphed into anger at the US Federal government and their total soulless incompetence.

This PIFC shit would apply to foreign mutual funds, foreign insurance companies, and some foreign publicly traded companies, too.  But the insane thing is, I could invest in the constituent securities of these foreign ETFs and avoid being treated by these tax rules.  It's totally arbitrary.  I can't invest that way, because I don't have the economy of scale to do that without worrying about all of the transaction fees, but, say, a huge hedge fund could do it no problem.  It's almost like the complexity of the tax code favors businesses and punishes the individual.  Hmm sound familiar??

It's also a classic example of the government directing investment.  Why is it that I can legally differ capital gains taxes forever by buying US stock and never selling it, but the same activity with foreign securities is taxed at 39% + plus interest over the holding period (Plus punishingly difficult compliance with reporting).  It should be my right to invest where I want, but the federal government is ""nudging"" me to keep me right here in the US, come what may.  What if I don't think the US is going to do amazingly the next couple decades?  

Specifics aren't important, it's a fucking mess.  And what I encountered is probably like 1/10000 of the tax code.  Tip of the iceberg as they say. 

A moment of silence for all the poor American expats out there getting fucked by this rule every year.  Imagine them getting a retirement plan through their employer abroad, and then being obligated to pay expensive accountants just to remain in compliance with US law.  Filing hundred page tax returns just for receiving a retirement benefit from your employer.  This shit pisses me off so much I just might leave this country, I swear to fucking god.

My problem isn't just with this specific area of the tax code.  I'm not critiquing this specific problem I stumbled upon, or how it doesn't make any sense from a policy standpoint or a financial standpoint either.  It's that the whole thing doesn't make sense.  The whole machine is a completely messed up tangled behemoth which incentivizes behavior this way or that without any overarching thoughtfulness about whether its beneficial to the nation or whatever.  Just complexity for complexity's sake.  It's certainly good for accountants, but I'd bet it's a huge cost to America as a whole.

Biden's coming along.  Taxes are probably going to go up.  Fine, I'm resigned to it I suppose.  But are they going to get more or less complex.  My guess is, our country will apply another tier of shit on this big shit-cake that is the tax code.  Pile on a few more loop holes, ""close"" some other loop holes.  Yeah, just make it an even bigger pain in the ass.  That'll do the trick!

And as for decades, people without accountants and tax lawyers will get harassed, but the richest of the rich will be able to use the immense volume of complexity and ambiguity in the tax code to legally avoid paying as much tax, as has been the case for some time.  Hard to see any moral purpose to doing this way.

Obviously I would be in favor of a lower tax rate with no (or minimal) loopholes or deductions.  But I just can't envision this happening in the US.  I don't know why this country, for whatever reason, has tended towards greater and greater complexity, year after year, while many other countries have managed to keep their tax codes simpler and more streamlined.  I think we passed the crisis point years ago, but the problem shows no sign of slowing down.",2

Think about it like this: everyone has their issues that they care about.

For republicans, it’s raised taxes, China out performing the US on the world stage, liberals trying to take our second amendment away, general socialism and communism, and online conservative censorship.

For democrats, it’s abortion rights, climate change, “systemic racism”, gun control, and Covid.

What is it for you? A government growing in power? You have to sell to people that that is a bad thing even when they think that it is a good thing. So you have to sell to republicans that it is okay for a private business like google to wipe you off of their servers and scrub your entire existence, censoring you permanently. You have to sell to Democrats that guns— more lethal and unregulated military-grade guns— should be available to the general public for purchase. And you have consistently failed to do that.

You aren’t playing the game.

It’s like you guys are playing monopoly over there in the corner while dems and reps are playing chess in the middle of the room. It takes 8 hours to finish a monopoly game, and in that same light, you guys are moving like snails to grow your party. Additionally, you are looking at this all like a businessman would, like you’re making bets and gambling and looking at fucking stocks and trends.

Meanwhile, democrats and republicans are in the middle of the room playing chess; a 10-20 minute match depending on the speed, so way quicker than you, and they are thinking about things from a “win at all costs” standpoint. They get down and dirty and it gets replayed when they win the White House and get to put their ideas into law.

You guys? You won’t get down and dirty. You guys are spineless amoebas. 🦠

1,20,1546,251,"Do libertarians support land taxes? I have a problem with land ownership. I believe in theory originally every piece of land equally belongs to every human being, including unborn - just like air, water, any natural resources etc.

When land is taken private, it imposes limitations on other humans as it restricts them from accessing certain places - often without compensating others. 

Unlike enterprise or most products and services, new land generally can not be created and first settlers have advantage that can never be remediated, which puts future generations at ever-growing disadvantage as finite resources (i.e land) are valued more and more over potentially infinite goods that could be created and traded (cars, cell phones, services, etc) 

When extrapolated it can lead to some pretty bad situation when small group of people hoards all of good land dictating any conditions they want to the rest of population. 

That s why i think land should be taxed according to current market value, and if current owner can’t afford it they should move, and compensated the difference between outstanding taxes and sale proceeds when land is sold on auction. 

Any “improvements” should not be taxed, even tho they contribute to value of land (yeah i know there s room for cheating here). 

What is libertarian take on this? I imagine libertarians support things like “pollution tax” to compensate others for damage or inability to use certain resources (like air or water from the river). How is possession of land different in principle?",2

I understand that perspective. However, climate change is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. So, I want to understand how a libertarian would address it instead of trying to convince my libertarian family to my way of thinking. I don't care how it is addressed as long as it is addressed.

Everybody wants to turn a blind eye and hide from the other side by demonizing them. And you libertarians do the same exact shit.

I thought racism would be solved by now, and MLK Jr's dream would come true. Instead, we are talking about cultural appropriation and some historical debts that I own because my ancestors (who came to the Americas less than a century ago) somehow contributed to slavery.

I thought Bush's warmongering would end. Instead, his people are apparently going in the democrat administration.

1,37,2077,375,"Someone had the nerve to comment on a post about how it was disgraceful I was a libertarian applying for section 8 housing. Let me explain why I think libertarians shouldn’t be against section 8 housing because I think it’s important especially today. 1 bedroom housing for myself is at least $1000 at a minimum who works 40 hours a week at least during the summer with reduced hours because of covid and because of winter.  I make about $30,000-$35,000 a year and a shit amount after taxes.

In order to qualify for most housing I must make at least 40x the monthly rent.  Which would mean $40,000 so I don’t qualify at most 1 bedroom housing.

Bottom line is there’s a multiple year waitlist at section 8 housing for 1 bedroom housing and I’m about to have to give up my dog to go live in a car.  I may sell my car to maybe pay the whole rent up front but bottom line is, if we’re the self proclaimed greatest country in the world how the fuck is housing this bad?  

The free market does not provide it, and I think when a free market does not provide something because there isn’t enough incentive... this is totally fair because who builds a housing complex to charge the cheapest?  The government should not do it themselves, they should subsidize it to companies and it should all be based against the city or towns median average.

The argument against this would be that I could get roommates which is valid, but I am skeptical if that’s a really valid excuse to this housing crisis and multiple year waitlist for a one bedroom in section 8 housing.  I think something bigger is at play than “find a roommate”.

Wages maybe need to be raised but that would strain my already stressed out boss, I have taken up ubering to help her out because the business sometimes doesn’t serve people because of the pandemic.  

In my mind libertarians believe in government intervention, and we can’t artificially raise wages so at the base core I think identifying a housing crisis at hand for us laborers and expansion of housing for early in our career people would be excellent.",2

1,7,1673,266,"What opinion do libertarians have about neoliberals? Is it possible to be neoliberal and libertarian at the same time? About 2 years ago I started calling myself a 'neoliberal' to differentiate me from the 'libertarian pipe-line' that was happening in my country. To put it briefly I was one of the co-founders of the libertarian party of my country, at that time I was some kind of market-liberal or a consequentialist friedmanite who actually wanted to found the party more in line with Friedman's 'capitalism and freedom' than the Rothbardian libertarianism's dogma but at the same time, I proposed to be tolerant to other forms of libertarianism. Anyways things quickly went to hell, the party filled with religious conservatives, Trump-lovers, Hoppeans and philo-fascists. and eventually, after much discussion, myself and the original founders were cut off from the project. Today the party is simply one more extreme-right populist party and does not contribute anything positive to the weak democracy of my country. Since then I have been ideologically hybridized with 'neoliberalism' as a more pragmatic way of achieving economic progress, less state intervention in the life of people and increasing individual liberty. This more pragmatic and less dogmatic approach has allowed me to have enriching conversations with people from across the political spectrum and to draw them more into an enthusiasm for the free markets, perhaps with the exception of authoritarians.

The premise is that as our productivity has increased in the last several decades the hourly compensation for workers has remained almost stagnant, corrected for inflation, due to CEOs and the people at the top taking the majority of the increased productivity as profit. 

I’m curious what you all make of this but my understanding of this is that as productivity has gone up prices of goods has gone down allowing companies to sell products for less causing a majority of workers to be paid about the same.

So yes while productivity has gone up costs of goods has gone down due to market competition and in turn compensation has remained somewhat steady while increasing slightly.",2

1,38,815,135,"Free Market Healthcare Hey all, got into a discussion with someone recently over government funded health care. I’m personally libertarian to the core, but they brought up an interesting point. The U.S. has the freest health care industry in comparison to modern developed countries. While I recognize that this is due in part to overburdensome regulation, what is the libertarian solution to this?

Another interesting point they brought up was that due to the incredible cost to build a hospital, it’s not really a free market in many ways. And, when you are incapacitated and need medical care, you don’t actually get to choose a provider. Thoughts?

TL:DR, if we have the freest healthcare (ie not government run) in America vs other countries, why is it so damn expensive in comparison? Thoughts on a solution?",2

Why? I’ll tell you why dammit

You see when poor people apply to things such as Obama or Medicare it creates a market that is always supplied 

So business that make your medicine or medical equipment say “Let’s charge big prices to the government and they’ll still buy it from us” so then they did it 

And this hurts middle class families that are too rich for these healthcare plans but too poor to just not be hurt by the prices 

You see if Uncle Sam simply allowed healthcare companies to compete with one another (while setting laws to make sure they don’t work together to just rig the system) then companies would work their asses of to get cheap medicine and medical equipment for as best as possible lowering costs tremendously

And because the costs are going down healthcare would go the way of the microwave, or the TV, or the fridge, or the internet etc. etc. 

Before you ask what I mean by “go the way of the fridge” it was referring to the fact that at first these items were only for upper middle class to rich class people to afford but due to companies wanting to expand their market they worked to find ways to lower costs to get their way to the lower middle class and to the poor class too

If America became the first country to do this not only would poor and middle class people get affordable healthcare they would be able to do this without the need for taxes


Edit: also poor people before got their healthcare before these programs with charities",2
1,12,1879,348,"So I tried to ask a question on the Lincoln Project Subreddit and they mocked and banned me... So basically I was just asking what the whole thing was about. I personally don’t like trump at all, I think he doesn’t actually fit with my type of conservatism, right libertarianism and center right sort of beliefs. He is very pro-government and anti-free market in his policies, and hasn’t been attacking big government programs like I would want him to. On top of all his bullshit on Twitter which I don’t like. 

Anyways, so I heard that some old tea party republicans created this thing called the Lincoln project to sort of try to cleanse the maga from the republican party, which I’m all for. However I also noticed that there seemed to be some influence from the DNC baked into it, So in my post I asked if the Lincoln Project was indeed a conservative started, owned, and backed movement, and not just a front for the DNC to help get trump out of office. I told them I wanted to know if the Lincoln Project was for actually getting evidence on how trump is not conservative, like the tariffs and big spending on social programs for example, rather than the usual partisan trump bashing. 

Well unfortunately, all I got was a kind of answer from an albeit nice user which said to look up the profiles of the guys, and a mocking response from a mod that insinuated I was a Trump supporter even though I said I didn’t like trump, before he proceeded to Ban me and then mute me so I couldn’t ask why I was banned.

All that being said I’m still lost on the Lincoln Project, and have no idea where to find credible information on what it is and does. And seeing as how I probably won’t be banned for asking about a possible DNC front for taking down a right-wing populist in a server full of politically homeless chads, I thought this might be a good place to search for answers.",2

Mainly ones to do with “hedonism” and “degeneracy“ which apparently just mean any type of consumption (even moderate) of drugs, alcohol, porn, etc. They keep saying it’s gonna cause the fall of civilization, which I guess is right if one's vision of civilization is no drugs, alcohol, and porn, but that's just kinda circular (but if we allow X, then we’re not gonna be able to have an X-free society) 

They also say not getting married and having kids is selfish because it lowers the fertility rates. But how do I address that there's no objective metric for fertility rates being top priority at the expense of individual freedom? What's the point of having kids just so they can be subjected to the same obligation of sacrificing their independence and happiness to keep the next generation going and repeat the cycle?

This argument in particular is one that irks me cuz it assumes that the activity is bad or worth being ashamed of in the first place, which is also what the argument is trying to prove:

”Libertarianism and individual liberty would only work if people had shame, which they don't.”

So having a world where you're allowed to do what you want (as long as no one else suffers) is bad because the people might not be ashamed of doing what they want, which is what the purpose of that world is (to do what one wants)?

If you look at the graphs of the votes being counted there is just no way that trump could be in the lead and they just happen to find a ton of votes all of them for biden.  That is statistically near impossible.  And biden got more votes then I think anyone else in history.  Even more then obama and he barely campaigned.  And was lucky to have twenty people show up to his rallies.  Whereas trump get tens of thousands of people at his rallies plus boat parades and a hundred mile long car parade.  But that isn't the point.  

The point is that stealing elections is pathetic.  And it shows the utter contempt that they have for us.  If their platform is so wonderful then they should no problem running a candidate and winning the election fairly.  But they can't do that so they cheat.  And it wasn't just the presidential election they cheated.  It was the congressional and state and local elections.  I think a lot of these insane governors like newsom in california are only in power because of election fraud.  So they've stolen not just the presidential election but a lot of other elections.

I learned so much and it forced you to look at any and all solutions to the real problems we face. My focus happened to be on the environment (I can't remember if I was assigned this topic or chose it). Things like the future of our oceans and coral reefs, stuff like that. Even though I was quite conservative in high school it was obvious that there were real problems that we'd be facing if we didn't do something within the following couple of decades, and it was also quite clear that when humanity comes together we really can solve global issues (see: the ozone layer).

As someone who loves reading about proposed solutions and discussing these things, it's super depressing to see where we are today. I firmly believe that the reason the political discussion has gone downhill so much is because we can't even agree on reality. 

15 years ago, the realities we couldn't agree on (imo) were things like whether the 9/11 attacks were a conspiracy or not, and whether the moon landing was real. 

Now, ask 2 random people if Biden really got 80 million legal votes and really got more votes in PA, GA, and AZ and there's a very real chance there will be disagreement. In 2000, I just don't remember this being the case with that election. 

Ask 2 people whether global warming is real (not even man-made, just whether its real), and there's a decent chance you get 2 different answers.

Do masks prevent the spread of Covid?

Is Covid real?

Is Q Anon real?

Is Mexico paying for the wall?

Is there systemic racism of any kind in our society?

Do people that aren't allowed to vote, vote by the hundreds of thousands (or millions)?

Does increasing the access to birth control and improving sex education decrease the amount of abortions?

There are probably a dozen more questions that could be listed.

How can a proper discussion of what to do about Covid or global warming even take place when there isn't even agreement about whether they exist? 

The reason I think we've reached the point of no return is because political commentators/celebrities have figured out how to keep their fans believing anything, and social media has allowed people to sit and marinate in their respective camps. We now have anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, Q anon people, mass shooting deniers, covid deniers, global warming deniers, and religious extremists. What happened to the folksy JFK conspiracy people? I wish we could just go back to that.

Anyways. I'm rambling. I haven't even gotten into the animosity that people feel towards the ""other side,"" either because they feel the other side is stupid or evil.

For right-leaning people that think the other side is evil/stupid for their viewpoints:
 
Please remember that global warming was accepted by John McCain and other Republicans leaders in the early 2000s, and oil companies have known about the effects of CO2 for decades. 

The tax rate under multiple republican administrations was far higher than whatever Biden wants to put it at, and we had the best economic growth in the 90s when income tax rates were higher than they are today.

Ronald Reagan allowed 1+ million illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. and as far as I can tell the U.S. hasn't been destroyed yet. George W. Bush called for compassion and really wanted to pass comprehensive immigration reform. 

Nixon wanted to pass a UBI, and also created the EPA. The air in Los Angeles looks a lot better today than it did 30-40 years ago.

For the left that thinks the right is evil/stupid because of their viewpoints:

Bill Clinton and other democrats really wanted to limit illegal immigration in the 90s, moreso than any previous president. This doesn't make them racist.

Anyways, this post is too long already.

2. You have no solutions just a hope, no near-religious belief, that ""free market"" will solve all problems as soon as we get government out of the way. Completely ignoring the fact that people bring government in only when things do not naturally resolve themselves
3. Your arrogance is baffling. Especially when paired with the fact that you have no successes to call your own
4. Your goals are mutually exclusive. It is impossible to achieve full social and economic liberty at the same time. If I am allowed to hire and fire people based on any factor, then history shows us that minorities will have the glorious freedom of eking out a pathetic existence on the outskirts of society.
5. You are hypocrites. You shout ""taxation is theft"" and ""get government out of &lt;insert field here&gt;"" and yet you really like your property rights and contracts. What do you think ensures that a contract is worth more than the paper it is printed on?
6. You accuse others of incompetence while running candidates like Jo and Spike. I would rather have a comatose walrus in charge than an adult man who named himself after a children's cartoon show character.
7. You have too much trash in your ranks. I was curious about libertarians during this election and a subreddit like r/goldandblack might as well be r/conservative lite, while this very subreddit is a dumpster fire of people pushing their agendas with little to no libertarian voice.

8. The few solutions that you do offer are either childishly simplistic or so vague that they are worse than useless. ""Cut regulations"". Ok. Which ones? Will it help? Which ones first? Did you guys forget about all the lead that was put into random things?

1,2,2176,399,"Relating Covid laws to drug laws. I just gotta get this off my chest.  You know what's really pissing me off?  First off, I don't think the government should arrest people for having too many Thanksgiving guests.  But why do cops get to ignore their orders?  For at least a decade I've been saying ACAB because they are the enforcers of unjust laws, and if they actually were good, they'd disobey their orders to enforce nonviolent drug offenses and stop locking non-criminals in prison.  

And I was always met by conservatives with ""They're just doing their job.  They have to enforce the law even if they don't agree with it.""  Well, now we can plainly see that's a lie, and they simply choose to enforce whatever the fuck laws they personally see as just.  So now those same conservatives saying both: 1) The government is who gets to decide what I'm allowed to do with my own body and mind, and 2) Cops don't have a choice but to enforce the law so I can't really blame them; really don't give a fuck about the oppression of others as long as its not them or their chosen activities being deemed illegal.

This should also put to bed any pro-life arguments.  Even if it means another life is taken or in danger, the government can't tell you what to do with your own body.  Anti-vaxxers (for mandatory vaccinations) should be pro-choice.

And again, I don't think the government should jail anyone over Thanksgiving, but I bet nobody will see a prison cell for having 12 guests.  But just the threat of a fine, or being told from above what to do (even without an enforcement mechanism willing to act upon it), has elicited such a strong reaction from the same people who don't give a fuck if another human being spends years or decades of their life locked in a cage for possessing an unapproved plant.

This shit is just infuriating.  The ""nice"" cops who threw me in a cage 12 years ago and took away my future plans, had this attitude of ""ahh man I'm sorry for putting you in jail, but the law's the law and I'm just doing my job"".  I think this does prove that cops do have their own moral code, and they can disobey orders when they want to, they just choose not to.",2

They're cowards.  And yet they defy their own laws and risk catching the so called coronavirus.  Also they ignore lockdowns and masks when it's politically convenient.  If antifa and blm are rioting they don't say anything about the coronavirus.  But if it's a trump rally then it's a super spreader.  If it was a real virus it wouldn't pick political sides.  You just don't have this kind of double standard with a real virus.  So can someone explain why the politicians are so reckless if there really is a virus?,2

One of my business partners had a brother who worked on capital hill for 14 years, and his oldest daughter is pretty high up in the Trump administration, so obviously he knows everything there is to know about politics and the inside workings of Trump.

If you have never tried what we've done I don't fully appreciate your criticism.

The big cities would look like the ninth level of hell as crime runs totally wild with no opposition.  It would make the riots we've seen so far look like a fireworks party.

1,6,3350,534,"Remember when people fought against a singular ""establishment""? I am an American of Mexican decent. I was born in the former and lived in the latter, for a while. My brother was always busy, running from a fatherless home. The only thing he left behind was his music. Tupac became my role model. Rap culture has always stood for the anti-establishment. The fight against oppression. A megaphone for hidden America to shout it's condition into.

The impoverished are ignored in the global plans of the ruling elite. Years ago, Minorities crawled out of poverty through the athletic or entertainment stage. The early days of the entertainment industry glorified the model American. The heroes were tall white men with square jaws. Saving the town from a dark man, usually wearing black or sometimes dark complected. The industry began leaning towards a more progressive era. Minorities and their culture started breathing new life into a industry that had been sucked dry of ""appropriate"" material.

The Vietnam war fueled a wave of radical leftist art. The ""commies"" started infecting the mind of the all-American youth. These radicals fought what they called ""the establishment"".

Capitalism accidentally solved this by bestowing rightfully earned riches upon these influential enemies of the state. (The ones who hadn't been murdered or OD'd) Turning them into the rags to riches stories that have become capitalism's biggest tool for recruiting the young.

The European frescos of biblical imagery from the 15th century, imagined characters who were Middle Eastern as ""shredded"" white men with big beards. There are even images of the Pharaoh that opposed Moses as a white man with black hair. Then the aforementioned early days of Hollywood. Then women, drugs, jewelry, mansions, and cars are the new acceptable image.

THE ESTABLISHMENT 2020

In the year of our lord 2020; what is the establishment? Did the establishment decree that you can no longer use homophobic slurs? Or does the establishment want to take away everybody's guns? Is the establishment trying to legalize abortion, or take it away? Is the legalization of Cannabis a consequence of the anti-establishment  becoming a part of it's former adversary? Or is it selecting another culture to infect.

The information age has also undermined a lot of the establishment's institutions. The internet has propagated ideas that have been suppressed by our beloved keepers of morality and truth.

For example: 

Santa Claus was black.

Jesus wasn't born on Christmas.(or at all)

Corporations and capitalism have oppressed and destroyed countries all over the world.

The existence of Confederate statues.

#metoo

One would say that my list is overwhelmingly conservative. There is a reason why they are called ""conservatives"". They want to conserve. Protect the values of a great civilization.

I understand the urge to do things just because the government tells you not to (confederate flags), or to not do things just because the government tells you to do a thing (masks).

Look at confederate flags. For whatever reason, if you're a person who has flown a confederate flag their entire life, cool. But if you're a person that went out and bought a confederate flag to fly after you heard about various institutions banning them, then you're a child. Daddy told you no and you're going to prove that you can do it anyway.

As a free spirited, rugged individual, I don't fly a confederate flag because I don't fly any flags, never have, never will.

Masks. I see people all the time who only wear their masks in places that have signs up requiring masks (they don't wear them in places that don't have signs requiring masks). And then of course there are the folks that are never going to wear masks simply because they want to be a child and not listen to their daddy government. In either case, these people are doing specifically what they're told or they're specifically doing the opposite of what they're told.

As a free spirited, rugged individual, I wear a mask everywhere. My mom came over to visit and I put a mask on in my own house. I don't wear a mask because the government recommends it. I wear one because the scientific community that knows far, far more about this virus than I ever will recommends it. The same scientific community that has provided the people I love with life saving medications and procedures recommend it. The same community that has developed the vaccines that will likely bring an end to this global pandemic recommend it.

1,111,1383,217,"If you are here, and you think INCREASED INTERFERENCE/REGULATION in the market place, or civil liberties, from ANY administration is good thing, you do not understand Libertarianism at a fundamental level. Libertarianism is about small government, it is about free and unfettered markets, and it is about minimal regulation and minimal government waste.  Restricting markets, liberties, and anything else is antithetical to Libertarian ideology across the board.  

I will admit, not everyone will agree with every aspect of any political view, myself included.  Having said that, if you fundamentally disagree with the idea that civil liberties should be unrestricted, and markets should be deregulated, those are the two largest core fundamentals of Libertarianism, so what is it you agree with?

Agree or disagree, you will anyway, but someone needs to say it.  Biden is *not* a Libertarian candidate, he is arguably *less* Libertarian than Trump in more ways than not (not that Trump was much of a Libertarian to begin with, but that makes it obvious how bad Biden is), and trying to defend progressive policy as somehow being a better fit with Libertarianism indicates to me that there is a disconnect in understanding of what Libertarians actually think ideologically.

1.  Rebuild trust with our German allies by deploying troops to Cold War levels, invading Poland and rebuilding the Holy Roman Empire.

2.  Reassert ourselves in the Pacific by invading Taiwan before the Chinese do.

3.  Air strikes in Ethiopia in support of the ongoing Ethiopian-Tigray war.  This is a beaut of a war for America to intervene in because it fits all the criteria:  geographical names the average America doesn't recognize, a simmering 30 year conflict and shitty governments on both sides.

1,56,1898,323,"Do not listen to Reddit. The Guatemalan Protests are not a Socialist movement, but a Libertarian one. The protests originally started because congress wanted to raise the national budget from 91 billion Quetzales (Guatemalan currency) to 99 billion. Most of this would go to fund inefficient and corrupt institutions such as the Central American Parliament. This would raise the national debt from 26% to 32%. People on Reddit are saying that people are protesting that money is being taken away from COVID and Hurricane relief but this is not true, more money was going to be sent that way, but the argument is that in true Guatemalan fashion, this money would just be pocketed by politicians and not be put to good use. The people who burned Congress (it was like half an office of Congress) are presumed to be university students from the state university, who are famous for being communists. The people who protested in the central plaza were peaceful. Some are claiming that the vandals were infiltrated government agents, but I don’t buy it, however I am not here to defend the government and say that they wouldn’t do these things. It is important to mention that the police has not been overly brutal, protesters were allowed to get quite violent (they stormed Congress while police had to watch), and no one has been killed by police. 22 vandals were arrested but the judge ordered their immediate release. I feel dirty defending the government in this sense but facts are facts. 

The Guatemalan Protests are due to irresponsible government spending, not a socialist movement as Redditors might have you believe.

Taking this idea seriously as a politcal or moral framework, it seems much harder to justify a value of complete personal freedom; subserviating all other values, then say that of axioms like 'generally people prefer life over death' or 'generally people prefer not to suffering with futility'. 

The problem I have is that while I believe people tend to value their freedoms (mostly by virtue of freedoms this type of economic society creates), they generally don't value a total freedom over the other axioms listed above. 

The problem of anarchism then becomes, how one can, without coersion and punishment, convince a larger societal group of people, that personal freedom and self determination rules supreme. Of course, you could kill detractors, but to stop any forms of freedoms first being recognized in law, and subsequently traded for other securities (like forms of justice), would always seem like an uphill battle.

Are you all familiar with Amazon Mechanical Turk? It's an Amazon product that gets people to take surveys from requesters that need ""human input"", like, for example, identifying objects in pictures to train AI. It sounds like a good innovation, connecting a need with a worker -- except that it's an absolute nightmare.

People earn an average (median) wage of $2 per hour, and only something like 4% earn &gt;$7.25. Whatever your opinions on the solution, this is a problem. The defense I can imagine Amazon would give if asked to defend this would be ""it's not intended to be a full time job"" -- but it has, in fact, become a full time job for people.

There is a libertarian solution I can imagine:

* Deregulate (I'm not sure what regulations exist that would be removed, but it would make sense to me that regulations do in fact exist that help large corporations at the expense of small businesses) 
* Small businesses have a better shot at taking down large corporations (hopefully)
* Now corporations have to play fair (which wouldn't solve the problem; requesters make the prices) 
* But also people have greater opportunity for economic advancement, meaning people don't have to be on Amazon Mechanical Turk all day and night to feed their family (good result, but the chain of reasoning is a bit long, and I don't exactly trust corporations not to exploit people -- I think economic exploitation, in some forms, can be a violation of the NAP -- I am a libertarian, but also a leftist)  
(if you want my reasoning for what I put in the parentheses: &gt;!While I agree in a good world people can freely consent to whatever wage they like, earning $2/hr is wage slavery even if it's ""free"". If you don't have adequate opportunity for economic advancement -- I hardly believe everyone on Amazon Mechanical Turk is """"""""""""""lazy""""""""""""""  -- that's hardly a hallmark of a free society.!&lt;)

So how can we either a) trust corporations to treat workers well and not simply better than the company across the road or b) ask people to treat workers well via a democratic system that doesn't amount to unnecessary regulation?",2

1,52,2693,457,"In Regards to the Covid Vaccine and Possible Enforcement. I keep seeing posts online that make the claim that even though you can't be forced to take the vaccine by the government, private businesses will require it in order to use their services or buy their goods. This implies that an individual choosing not to take the vaccine would be unable to utilize the services or purchase the goods of a private company without first showing proof of their vaccination. This has bothered me a lot lately as I am a healthy young person and I really don't want to inject a vaccine that was rushed and we have no information on the long term effects of the vaccine. So, as a Libertarian I got to thinking about the 4th amendment. Here is what it states for those that don't remember, ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.""

My thinking is that the 4th amendment could be applied to the situation that a private company would deny you access to their goods and services without first proving that you have taken the vaccine. Compare the wording to the 1st amendment where it states, ""Congress shall make no law..."" I know that all of the amendments to the Constitution are meant to be in regard to the actions taken by government toward the people, but a private company would need to utilize the government (police) in order to enforce such a policy.

One could still argue that because it is a private company none of this applies, but I would refer you to the preamble of the Constitution that states, ""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."" The important wording here is, ""We the People of the United States..."" Private companies in the United States are made up of citizens of the United States. In my opinion, because the 4th amendment does not specifically state that Congress is prohibited from enacting the wording of the amendment, and the preamble implies that the Constitution is a collective agreement among all citizens of the United States, a private company mandating, through policy, an individual to be subjected to ""unreasonable searches"" of their medical documentation violates the 4th amendment.",2

I was considering the harm principle by Mill and at first I completely agreed with it and thought that there should be no paternalistic laws, but then I realized that there is no clear definition of what constitutes harm to others and that many actions can cause indirect harm. 

For example, I used to think that there is no reason why seatbelts should be required because if someone chooses not to wear one, then they are just harming themselves. However, in the event of a crash, the person not wearing a seatbelt would likely be more seriously injured, and that extra damage would end up indirectly harming other people. For instance, if they have to be taken to the hospital, they will use hospital resources, and prevent those resources from going to other patients. This could cause severe harm to those other injured or sick individuals who now have to wait longer to be treated, or who could even be denied something like an organ transplant that they otherwise would have received if that one individual had been wearing a seatbelt. There is also the issue of the cost of treating that individual. If they receive medicare or Medicare then the taxpayers are harmed by the extra responsibility of funding the individual’s medical care.

I know this is a slippery slope about what does or does not constitute harm to others but now I think that it might be better to look at individual laws instead of making a broad assertion like the harm principle. So what do you guys think? Should seatbelt use be required?",2

&amp;#x200B;

On one side, libertarianism is about the nonviolence principle and about as minimal interference and aggression by the state as humanly possible.  Meaning in principle, only a plague of the threat level of the actual 1918 Spanish Flu would ever justify closures in the name of safety.  And while numerous public health extremists are convinced otherwise, there just isn't evidence pointing to this having been that severe a threat for months on end.

&amp;#x200B;

The flipside is that opposition to lockdowns has been linked as connected to Trump MAGA QAnon Illuminati conspiracies which in and of itself could be a severe issue as well.  If the main justification for being against lockdowns was viewing every Covid development and doctors advocating for restrictions as being bourne solely out of conspiracies, it could maybe lead to the larger, more pragmatic section of libertarians viewing them as necessary for public health because they don't want to be lulled into pure conspiracy minded observers.

Either he's up to something and he's really busy or he wants to make it look like he's given up right before he strikes back.  There are a lot of rumors that trump knew they would try to steal the election and let them do it so he could catch them in the act.  There is a rumor that he had the ballots watermarked.  I don't know that it's true though.  What I do know is that there are way more military planes in the air then their usually are.  So either he's preparing for war, and invasion, or he's using the military to conduct remote surveillance to catch voter fraud.  Military spy planes have cameras that can see through walls and hear what people are saying miles away.  So trump is up to something.  

Also he recently replaced his secretary of defense.  Why would he bother doing that if he though he wouldn't get a second term.  If that is the case he will gone in a few months.  Also the guy he picked for secretary of defense is former special forces.  And has experience in counter terrorism.  Just the kind of guy you would want in charge of the military if your expecting nationwide riots.  Why would there be riots.  If biden wins there won't be.  Although biden will make trump look like a saint.  And he's no saint.  But if trump wins a lot of biden supporters are going to start rioting.  So it might be a good idea to have someone in charge of the military who knows how to deal with things like that.  

So I would say trump will win the election in the courts.  And the biden's supports will start burning down the big cities.  I don't like riots.  But I guess it's better then the total tyanny we would get if biden actually got into office.  So I think trump will win.",2

Let's take another scenario, if a HIV positive person has sex with other person without protection and doesn't let them know beforehand, is that not a violation of NAP too?

Intentionally infecting others is a violation of property rights. Especially, since it can result in death with a lack of vaccine. You can compare it to common cold and ask ""where do you draw the line?"" but both of them don't carry equal and proportionate consequences.

Even if you take them to the extremes, in a Libertarian society, respective authorities will try to find the cost and consequences of both Common Cold and Covid and will see masks as the efficient solution and will most likely enforce mandatory masks in public places for Covid, instead of Common Cold. Solutions to common cold are widely available and it is much less harmful and insurance agencies would put numbers on both and come to a logical conclusion that a virus without a vaccine is much more dangerous.

You simply don't have a right to infect others. It is a violation of property rights. Public spaces and other's property aren't your own property. Even if it's your own property and you apply no mask policy there, example owning a mall, you should atleast let the people entering the mall know that they're susceptible to be infected because their body is their own property and they should know if it's being violated in some ways. Libertarian societies will be much more efficient and effective than the gibberish you guys are spouting everywhere.

This type of pseudo-scientific behavior has been making it's way into Libertarian subs for too long. Externalities like Climate change and pollution is another one. One of the Libertarian candidate was for environmental solutions and some Libertarians lost their heads over it and called it a let down. Some even claimed they'd vote for a Republican just for that. When asked if a company dumping polluted gas in their backyard and it resulted in catching lung cancer and eventual death, is that not a violation of property rights, they went silent and had no answers.

Just like Climate change, the virus is an externality. If tomorrow another virus appears which is much more deadly and can be avoided with wearing masks, would that change your behavior with regards to wearing a mask in public places, if it does you sir are a hypocrite eitherway.

Finally, stop gobbling up stupid Conservative and Alt-Right gibberish(looking at you Paleos, Tom Woods, Dave Smith, Mises Caucus and Conservatives pretending to be Libertarians) and learn about Libertarian ideals and solutions.

It’s socialism and it is specifically for the rich. The plan calls for up to $10,000 for the repayment of private student loans for people who are not in a position to pay the loans back themselves. 

It is so clear this is a handout for private lenders. If you make loans you’re in the business of calculating risk. If a person can’t pay back the loan you should be able to eat the loss by prior planning for the risk. That’s the business. This plan will give private lenders money that they presumably knew they would never get. So, free money.

I’ve brought this argument up to liberals and they say something like “well any student debt relief is helpful, Biden’s heart is in the right place.” If Biden’s heart was in the right place the student loan forgiveness would be for federal student loans, which make up 90% of the student debt and would be cheaper for the government to discharge than paying private lenders. It’s a classic situation of a wolf in sheep skin. The true goal is obviously to line the pockets of lenders with our tax money. 

The republicans are right that Biden is a socialist, but sadly for the socialists the intended beneficiary of his socialist policies are the rich.",2

1,96,2111,340,"There is constant debate about what 'anarchism' is and how an-caps aren't real anarchists. So, coming from an an-cap, I'd like to express my opinion to try and give some clarity. I'll start off with acknowledging that most libertarians are not full-out ancaps, but I believe there is a significant crossover. For instance, I consider myself a libertarian AND an anarcho-capitalist. Onto my point...I've been told here on this sub many times that ancaps aren't *real* anarchists...that we are bootlickers for corporations, or for churches, or for whatever institution they believe we worship. Here is why we are *real* anarchists.

**Monarchy** \- mono- (one) + archy (rule) = Rule by One

**Oligarchy** \- oli- (few) + archy (rule) = Rule by Few

**Anarchy** \- an- (without) + archy (rule) = Without Rule

In the political context of these words, the prefixes are describing the amount of *human rulers* in charge. Monarchy with a king/queen...Oligarchies with a small group of men/women. Most of us anarcho-capitalists extrapolate the same thing onto the word 'anarchy'. We are not intending it to mean ""without rules."" In our interpretation, the word '**anarchy**' means ""**without rulers**"". Just as it relates to the political context of its sister words (like monarchy, oligarchy, etc...).

There is nothing in it's etymology that lends itself to having to do with *hierarchies*, as many opponents to an-caps propose. 

Heirarchy - hier- (high, holy) + archy (rule) = rule by the high/holy

I understand that this boils down mostly to somewhat subjective semantics. Language evolves over time, but ancaps consider anarchy to mean ""without rulers"". This is the impasse that ancaps and ancoms (or other various forms of anarchists) arrive at. We simply consider the word to have slightly different difinitions.

I'm not trying to argue what the ""correct"" definition should be, simply just expressing what most of us ancaps are talking about when we discuss anarchism. Ancaps DO believe in hierarchies. We DO believe in rules and order. We simply just don't want to be governed by rulers without our consent.",2

Let’s look at that first one, life, if each person is granted the right of life, then why should they be denied lifesaving healthcare due to a lack of money? And all treatments no matter how small the ailment, can become life saving if left unchecked. That last statement is a good segway into my next claim, it will cost less. Now hear me out, put yourself into the shoes of an impoverished person, and you have a really bad cough, but the required medicine is 500 dollars, now it’s not life threatening, so you deny the treatment and carry on. Fast forward a few weeks, the cough has gotten worse and due to the 24/7 cough, your pharynx has developed rips, rips which have gotten infected. After doing nothing for it due to expensive antibiotics, you now develop sepsis, putting you in septic shock, requiring an expensive procedure to fix, a procedure which is covered in the current healthcare system. So instead of taxpayer money paying for 500 dollar medicine it now pays for a treatment that can cost upwards of 70,000 dollars per treatment.

First few days after the election, I was like whatever, he has a legal right to contest (legally) the election if he thinks the election was not conducted fairly. 

But now after 2+ weeks and his arguments looking more and more feeble, I don’t know how to react to this other than with anger and frustration. 

* Tangent warning....I consider myself extremely liberal on social issues, totally for legalizing drugs, but at the same time against high taxes. Because my own view on different subject contradict each other I am not sure what I am. But I am a free man free to believe in what I want. 

Coming back to the point:

1. Trump has stopped working: No events on his schedule except obvious election rigging meetings with electors. No fucks about Corona. No intelligence briefings for weeks. He is acting a like a mad gf you just broke up with—who has an hour in your apartment to pick up her stuff and is hell-bent on completely destroying your place while she still has a chance. He is pulling out troops left and right and he wants to start more altercations in the Middle East at the same time. He is acting with a revenge mindset. 

2. This contesting election thing is dragging too long without any substance. I expected that we would have a REAL bombshell by now. Not a dye leaking Rudy blabbering BS on a stage but saying exactly opposite or nothing while on oath in front of a judge. 

The thing that pisses me off the most is that most of their election fraud claims seems to be focused on Philadelphia county and Wayne county. And both fucking counties Joe Biden did worse than Hillary. What a shitty job of rigging by the democrats in these counties, they ended up doing worse than Hillary. Trump lost the suburbs because he was a dick the whole time last 4 years. Normal everyday suburban families don’t vote for a dick twice. Plus he was stupid to not become rich my selling MAGA masks but instead decided to deny the crisis. And stupidly he was against mail-in ballots when a lot of old people support him across the country. 


Now, can we get rid of him? I am afraid to hat is anger, revenge mindset etc. is going to lead to in the next two months? What is the libertarian viewpoint on this thought?",2

The idea hospitals shouldnt be privately owned
An ban on military grade weapons being bought and sold by the public 
Raising taxes on the rich

Do you guys have any literature for me, or any arguments even that could give me a libertarian perspective on those issues?

&amp;#x200B;

Ive worked for a few charities, and the ones who actually have an impact take the ""teach a man to fish"" approach

&amp;#x200B;

We also have dying trades in many areas, which is an issue in itself

&amp;#x200B;

SO - what if for those who have fallen through the cracks, we set up trade programs in communities that are either tax funded or also funded by people paying back (with little or no interest) some of the training after a few years in the field. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, that alone isnt enough. It needs to actually be a feasible track for success AND these people need to be able to eat while they learn. I think I'd actually strongly consider using tax dollars to help with their expenses (which they again pay back over time likely)  so long as they show active learning/involvement/etc (would have to work out what that looks like of course)

&amp;#x200B;

Goal would be to get people out of the poverty loop while boosting necessary trades in places where theyre dying

&amp;#x200B;

1,44,1848,308,"Libertarians-and the “War on Christmas” Well, the season is upon us.  And with electoral events, I expect this one to come roaring back to the forefront. My recollection of how this all started goes like this: 

In the late 90’s and early 2000’s online retail first began to take a real bite out of seasonal holiday sales. Brick and mortar retailers, probably seeing the writing on the wall, began engaging all kinds of wacky policy to try to save those holiday sales, such as being open on bloody Thanksgiving-something that it took a pandemic to shake them out of. And another was asking employees to greet customers with “Happy Holidays” on the off chance that non-Christians might prefer that.  Bit of a stretch, but panic makes people do silly things.  In effect, it was just capitalism at work.   


Right wing talking heads seized this as proof of a sinister campaign to ”take the Christ out of Christmas,” and soon thereafter Republican politicians began using it as a wedge issue to rally voters. This reached new heights during the Obama presidency, during which social mores experienced a shift, most notably the legalization of gay marriage and growing support for gay aNd trans rights-much to the chagrin of the Evangelical right, who proclaimed it as proof of cultural change being forced on them. Now, after twenty years of this, millions of Americans legit believe that at some point, somewhere, a person got offended by hearing “Merry Christmas” and that it proves Christianity is under siege AND that people have become wusses.   


And all the while I’ve been asking “Ever try being Jewish in this country every eleven months? Forbid, being Hindu, Buddhist, or Muslim? Talk about having something forced on you!”

NASA and SpaceX launched a rocket over the weekend carrying a group of astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). This wasn’t the first time the Dragon capsule carried human passengers into space — that honor goes to the Demo-2 mission earlier this year. However, this is the first regular ISS crew rotation mission for NASA to utilize a commercial spacecraft. After years of development, the Commercial Crew Program has succeeded. 

The launch included three NASA astronauts: Shannon Walker, Victor Glover, and Michael Hopkins. The fourth crew member was JAXA’s Soichi Noguchi. This is the culmination of years of work at NASA and its commercial partners to design and test human-rated spacecraft that could replace the Space Shuttle for US launches. Ever since the Shuttle was retired, NASA has been forced to purchase seats on Russian Soyuz rockets to reach the station. That arrangement was expensive, and the agency was running out of guaranteed seats after numerous Commercial Crew delays.",2

But now when I look at the current state of this country..... it's becoming harder to argue that Putin isn't salivating at the discourse in our country. From a corrupt, dangerous, self entitled, man-child president who will absolutely do anything to either stay in power at all costs or cause as much damage, dysfunction and heart ache on his way out, to a fully complicit GOP who have no qualms about the president's rhetoric and actions and some will even do his bidding (seen recently with the republican election officials in Michigan) as long as it helps them stay in power, to also a nation that half of which (ok maybe not half) not only believes anything and everything the president says(along with other blatantly disinformation that the president watches) but also have a deep interconnection with him thus if he says that he's being cheated they'll also feel that their being cheated.

So if meth, for instance, is legal but profoundly discouraged and we punish drug trafficking with exceedingly harsh mandatory sentences, problematic Drug gangs that sell meth would vanish, drug trafficking would nosedive, the rate of meth users may decrease (chill let me explain), and It'll boost the economy. The legal process should be so. If an individual wish to purchase \*insert hard-drug here\*, they must be 18 firstly. As opposed to a higher age, my reason for this is that they can serve in the military, purchase firearms, and be recognized as legal adults; therefore, we should offer them the right to do this. We should require them to sign various contracts verifying that they acknowledge the adverse effects of \*insert-hard-drug here\* and the harsh legal repercussions of committing any crime while under the influence or purchasing it illegally alone, legally order them to watch a documentary depicting the dreadful consequences of usage. We should also legally mandate them to attend a lecture by formal drug users describing how \*insert hard-drug here\* ruined their lives, pass a brief test proving that they recognize the implications, and sign one more contract confirming everything. After that, It's their choice, and if they do anything wrong while on the substance or obtain it illegally, they'll receive an exceedingly harsh punishment.

I believe having it work this way would decrease the number of meth users due to them having a comprehensive grasp of what they're doing in opposition to just having it illegal and tossing them in jail whenever they use it (only for them to come back out and do it again, or even do it while in prison). People who don't wish to use meth don't use it because the legal books state it's illegal; they don't use it because they don't wish to become addicts because most people understand the consequences; the educational aspect of my proposal would only exacerbate that. If it remains illegal, drug-trafficking will continue, and those who seek to obtain drugs would still get it regardless of legal status. This way of doing it would cripple drug traffickers because, practically, their business model is the only way to obtain the substance is illegally, and they can provide it illegally. If the article is legal, they have zero incentive to traffic it if their potential customers can obtain it without facing the legal repercussions of even purchasing it from them, all for a reasonable price; combine that with the fact that the intensive education would lower their customer base, drug trafficking gangs would be on suicide watch. We should also drive anti-drug pedagogy in schools. This would diminish drug-trafficking, lessen the number of drug users overall, and help boost the economy if the government provides it.

Although I'm not an expert, that's my proposal. All opinions and criticism are welcome and wanted.",2
1,22,2652,486,"Can someone help me understand libertarianism? So here is my dilemma: I consider myself to be conservative. But I’m also not one of those people who will completely bend to the will of one party or another. If something is bullshit, it is bullshit whether Trump does or whether Bernie Sanders does it.

I believe that capitalism is the way to go. Socialism has been tried and failed too many times. I acknowledge that it’s a good concept in theory, but when it comes right down to it you might as well call it communism. Everyone should work for what they have. There is a time and place for the government to help and it isn’t meant to step in and give handouts to people in their early twenties who are too lazy to work.

Socialized medicine= bullshit
Abortion= bullshit as a form of birth control, but it’s ok if the mother is going to die delivering or if she was raped.
Drugs= legalize them all. We all have a right to fuck up our own bodies and lives, so long as we don’t cause physical harm to anyone else in the process.
Gay marriage= I’m ok with it. What is it really hurting? I’m a Christian and I understand what Christians believe, but at the same time, gay partners deserve to get all of the benefits of marriage that straight partners do. However, I don’t want teachers shoving it down my future kids’ throats. I don’t want my kids to be homophobic or to hate gay people, but I also want to be the one to have discussions with them about it and for them to have the ability to form their own opinion about it one way or another.
BLM=major bullshit. On so many levels. Those poor people don’t realize they are being used to do the left’s bidding. I support their right to protest though, as long as it doesn’t result in violence to person or property. Race relations have gotten way better than they were for the last thirty years until the left decided to stir things up again. Everyone deserves EQUAL rights, but I don’t think that any race deserves SPECIAL right just because they look different than me. 
For the most part, I believe that this country is supposed to be free, so we should be free. Stop the censorship. Stop doing the left’s bidding. 

So, I guess what I’m wondering is this: is it possible that I’m a libertarian? 

I tried researching it and came up short on answers. It seems there’s not a one-size-fits-all definition for it. Wikipedia made it sound like it leaned towards communism, while other sites likened it to a more moderate version of conservativism. I watch John Stossel videos and they make a lot of sense to me. He claims to be libertarian.

0,66,3510,595,"Is wokeness a religion? Recently I figured out that those of my friends who are devoted SJW activists used to be somewhat religions before they converted into wokeness. Now they are all uncompromising atheists. It seems to me that there are some needs of our mind that traditional religions satisfy, and wokeness does it as well. Similarities are astonishing.

For example, each religion must be based on some irrational beliefs. You will not create a cult if you say ""the grass is green and the sky is blue"". It's quite another thing to say “A virgin gave birth to a son, who turned water into wine and rose from the dead”. Also you can say “some men menstruate”, “obesity doesn’t influence health”, “there’s no such thing as race”, “there’s no biological difference between men and women”. It’s highly counterintuitive and you know it can’t be really true, but religious cults are about faith, not about knowledge.

Both religion and wokeness give you a dream of paradise. Wokeness doesn’t literally promise you paradise but there’s clearly a dream of better society without oppression. Which is impossible to achieve, because “all white people are racists”, “all men are sexist”. There’s no concrete plan and criteria of success - unlike in case of the struggle of suffragettes for the right to vote in elections - so it’s a dream, not a political agenda. And the dream will come true not in our lifetime.

Wokeness just like religion gives people a purpose of life. You don’t just eat, sleep, do your run-of-the-mill job, buy a new iphone, and understand that in 100 years nobody will remember you, and nothing you accomplish will matter. For some people that’s ok, but some want more. With wokeness you can persuade yourself that you participate in creating a better world, and your life matters in some higher sense. 

In any religion there’s rationalization. Probably, you heard some Christians saying something like that “Christianity is about obvious moral rules: don’t steal, don’t kill, respect you parents etc. Bible if of course a metaphor. But people used to be uneducated for centuries and some remain so today. If they need to literally believe in a fable - good for them if it helps them live a moral life”. I heard precisely the same argument from Sean Carrol on his podcast. He said “Probably very few people really believe that there’s no biological difference between men and women. But think why this phrase was coined. It serves a purpose to achieve equality between men and women even if it’s not really true”. The same line of argumentation. As well as some Christians believe that “don’t kill, don’t steal” is impossible without Christianity, SJWs believe that equality is impossible without wokeness.

Also, belief in God is unfalsifiable, which means that there’s no way you can prove or disprove it. For example “There is no flying from fate” is unfalsifiable, it gives you no new information, just a way of perceiving life. The same with “everything is about a struggle between the oppressors and the oppressed”, or “institutional racism”. If you believe in unfalsifiable ideas, no fact in the world can change your mind.

Finally, both religious fanatics and SJWs react the same to skepticism or jokes about their sacred stuff. Try to do it if you have both religions and woke types among your friends, and you will see that the same buttons of human psyche are pressed.

This is my today's reasoning. I may be wrong, of course. You’re welcome to disagree, it may be interesting.",2

5,19,1965,360,"Does NAP apply to potential mental harm done to others as a result of choices made by an individual? So I have never posted here before, but I have really enjoyed reading from the point of view of allowing such open discourse, so thanks everyone.

To my question: I have seen a number of posts over time discussing the NAP as a guide for what should/could reasonably constitute restriction of certain freedoms in the interest of the harm that not doing so may cause to others (feel free to correct if that is wrong). But one of the topics I have seen discussed previously numerous times as an example of such a restriction without basis is seatbelt/helmet laws. 

As a premise, it seems pretty obvious - you don't wear a seatbelt, you only have yourself to blame if you are injured or die - your choice. But this seems geared toward the idea of physical harm only, short or some crazy circumstance where you are thrown into a passerby or something. I am interested to see how it might apply to less tangible harm. Quite a number of years ago, a friend of mine witnessed a rather grisley motorcycle accident where the driver was not wearing a helmet. Quite a few people  including him, went to give help, but he ultimately did not make it mostly due to the pretty obvious head trauma. The issue that he had was that, though he did not realize it at the time, he was quite affected by what he saw as he approached this poor man. Sparing the details, though he does quite well now, there was a long period of nightmares and other issues that had to be dealt with before he got back to himself again.

My question really applies to what type of harm must be caused in order to violate the NAP? Clearly more people than he have had traumatic experiences as a result of other peoples poor judgment. But is this enough to restrict the freedom to make those choices, and if not, where does the line between tangible and intangible harm lie?

Thanks again for everyone here.",2

I see a lot of people post in subs about politicians not doing enough when it comes to covid.   No one can really tell me what ""enough"" means.  These same people are also still whipped into a frenzy over the virus. 

Can someone explain to an autist why there is still so much hysteria? 

It would seem to me that covid-19 is dangerous, but not the killer it was initially projected to be.  We're nearing 300k deaths nationally attribute to covid or ""covid related"" illnesses. Some of the early  numbers have proven disingenuous, but I digress. We generally have 60k to 80k influenza or influenza related deaths annually, which might have been displaced by covid in 2020.  It seems it is generally accepted that covid is twice as deadly as influenza. For most of the general population that means nothing. 

I understand not wanting to get sick, wanting to take precautions, and wanting other people to be cautious as well.  What I can't understand is militant shrieking about ""somebody please do something!!"", ""Fuck you science denier! People are literally dying unless we shut down everything!""  Everything except grocery stores, Amazon shipping, big box retailers, salons, gyms, etc.  I'm running into the same people who are vocal about stuff are also the most hypocritical.  We had a bunch of mom's this year crying about people going trick or treating (I'm being serious, there was a video posted of a woman in tears) but yet half of them were just getting home or just leaving for out of state vacations. The other half were out all over town the week before doing stuff.

It seems to be almost as misinformed a position as the hoaxers.

I've been disappointed in the GOP since the 2016 election. I didn't like nomination of Trump and I didn't like the surge in populism and other ideologies that it caused. I've never been a Trump supporter, but I hoped that maybe the GOP would be able to right the ship if he loses. I was so wrong.
    
    
    
Instead of admitting defeat and modifying their platform, the GOP doubled down with a refusal to peacefully concede and a childish insistence that the Democrats cheated, which is an affront to democracy. Even worse, the scum of American society have crawled out of the gutters in support. Watching the MAGA March, my theories were confirmed. The GOP has gone off the deep end. Their base has morphed into violent individuals shouting racist chants and attacking reporters. Instead of the American flag, they now fly the blue line flag; a desecration and an insult to patriotism. A resurgence in Nazism and neo-confederate beliefs has also occurred, breeding hateful, fascist ideologies.
    
Even worse, they have stolen libertarianism. First they stole our flag, plastering on their trucks next to the Stars 'n Bars and their collection of Trump stickers. Even the icon at their subreddit is the Gadsden. Do they even know what it means? It says ""Don't Tread On Me"", not ""Don't Tread On Me, So I Can Tread On Everyone Else"". Then, with people like Shapiro, they stole the word libertarian itself. Now people think I'm sort of ""Tea Party"" neo-conservative, even though I share almost no beleifs with them.
    
The GOP has fully radicalized, and there is nowhere to go. The DNC is increasingly anti-gun and is moving further left. Compromise has died. Both sides now believe that the other side is better off dead. As our political system gets more binary, divided, and radicalized, Libertarian-friendly policies and politicians are getting rare, as each side offers some rights at the expense of others. When the Bill of Rights is eventually voided, the dream will have died.
    
I used to think the GOP was the lesser of the two evils, although I hated their immigration and drug policies. Now, I am no longer sure. We are stuck between two increasingly authoritarian parties with their rabid supporters, in a system that chokes out a third option. Does anyone else feel the same?",2

However, conscription remains in place on a contingency basis and all male U.S. citizens, regardless of where they live, and male immigrants, whether documented or undocumented, residing within the United States, who are 18 through 25 are required to register with the selective service system.

10% Up to $9,875 so $9875/10 = $985.50 taxed

12% $9,876 to $40,125 so 40,125 - 9,876 = $30,249 x 0.12 = $3,629.88 taxed

22% $40,126 to $85,525 so 85,525 - 40,126 = $45,399 x 0.22 = $9,987.78 taxed

24% $85,526 to $163,300 so 163,300 - 85,526 = $77,774 x 0.24 = $18,665.76 taxed

32% $163,301 to $207,350 so 207,350 - 163,301 = $44,049 x 0.32 = $14,095.68 taxed

35% $207,351 to $518,400 so 518,400 - 207,351 = $311,050 x 0.35 = $108,867.50 taxed

37% Over $518,400 to 1,000,000 - 518,400 = $482,600 x 0.37 = $178,562

37% Over $518,400 to 10,000,000 - 518,400 = $9,481,600 x 0.37 = $3,508,192

37% Over $518,400 to 100,000,000 - 518,400 = $99,481,600 x 0.37 = $36,808,192

37% Over $518,400 to 1,000,000,000 - 518,400 = $999,481,600 x 0.37 = $369,808,192

**Okay now time to calculate the TOTAL tax percentage of each individual earner.**

If you make $9,875 a year you pay $985.50 in taxes that's a rate of 10%

If you make $40,125 a year you pay $4,615.38 in taxes that's a rate of 11.5%

If you make $85,525 a year you pay $14,603.16 in taxes that's a rate of 17.07%

If you make $163,300 a year you pay $33,268.92 in taxes that's a rate of 20.37%

If you make $207,350 a year you pay $47,364.60 in taxes that's a rate of 22.84%

If you make $518,400 a year you pay $156,232.10 in taxes that's a rate of 30.13%

If you make $1,000,000 a year you pay $324,806.32 in taxes that's a rate of 33.47%

If you make $10,000,000 a year you pay $3,555,556.60 in taxes that's a rate of 35.55%

If you make $100,000,000 a year you pay $36,855,556.60 in taxes that's a rate of 36.85%

0,48,2733,456,"If you want to oversee the biggest transfer of wealth from rich White people to poor Black people, abolish school districts and support school choice Yes I mean this 100% unironically. Here's how I think we could do it, but obviously there are multiple ways to go about this:

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, a child's zip code decides where they go to school and by extension their opportunities in life. Schools are funded by property taxes and areas that are poorer are less property rich; thus, the cycle continues. This is effectively opportunity hoarding and rewards segregationist, uncapitalist policies like zoning laws to keep Black people out of majority White neighborhoods.

&amp;#x200B;

Bush's NCLB was very ambitious however the main issue wasn't solved; school districts. Every American child should be able to go to *every* American school. They should be free to choose. There is literally no reason why your child should be forced to move schools if you move down one block.

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's end that. Every student is worth the same, so fund them the same. Any American student can go to any public or charter school they want, and have it funded in full. Private schools that have admissions criteria could be funded on a sliding scale, with those below the poverty line paying nothing and the middle class paying reasonable rates. The upper class would pay higher rates but ultimately they also have better resources to get their kids into the schools so it evens itself out.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of making schools different because of how much funding they have, we can create a specialty for every public school depending on the local economy. For example, maybe there would be a school in your city that grants diplomas in the skilled trades. Another focuses more on STEM. This would encourage charter/private schools to create similar programs.

&amp;#x200B;

And last but not least let's quit encouraging low income students without much knowledge of finances to get into loads of debt for a four year degree or literally die in a useless war just to get an education when we can graduate kids at 18 or even 16 with skills they'll need to function as adults instead of the useless fluff we currently teach.  Stop handing out federal student loans like candy to universities that charge unreasonable tuitions.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading my post. I wanted to unite the school choice Libertarians, NCLB Bushites, and Leftists who support reparations under a common goal. I believe this is the best way to give opportunity to Black (well ALL kids but particularly Black children who have been held back by our current system) kids in a politically feasible and also let's be honest not racist way.",2

When someone says the bit about healthcare, what they really mean is, ""I want the government to fully subsidize healthcare for every person living in the US through taxpayer dollars.""

After saying that I don't have and never had black friends, I was called racist almost immediately, without any questions or further discussion, 7/10 times I'd say.

It seems rather ridiculous overall, classifying someone (mainly white people) as racist simply because they don't have a colorful friends or maybe even because they don't have enough colorful friends, as if there is a number of black/brown/asian friends required to not be racist.

This situation is even more ridiculous in my case. My country is probably over 99% white and around 90-95% homogeneous.

I know you want to believe it was the most secure election in history, but if you listen to the eye witness evidence, it was a sham. That is exactly why every media outlet is touting it was secure and Biden won.  I mean no disrespect to anyone, but if people cannot see the level of corruption in our leadership, or choose not to because they want to believe so badly that the majority of the country wants to move towards socialism, if they cannot see the ungodly undercurrent behind the promises of this utopian dream that will turn quickly into a dystopian nightmare, then just like so many other nations we are headed for a fall. That is why you believe our constitution needs to be rewritten. You believe in a utopia of shared wealth run by people that are altruistic. Human nature actually runs the other way. Other nations have rewritten their foundational documents because they didn’t work. The democratic national party makes promises they cannot keep so you will give up your freedoms for perceived fairness and safety. The problem is you cannot legislate the heart of man, no matter how you do it. And things like thought policing (evidenced in hate crimes legislation) is only the beginning. I am sad that so many from your generation (from their very mouths - our friends two daughters) want socialism, free education, free healthcare, hate crimes legislation, thought policing, etc. Our educational system have done you all a disservice, and for that I apologize we have allowed the hatred of our country to be taught for so long. I love living here, and if others do not, there is a wide world of options. There are many socialist countries to choose from that people can go to, they ought to if they do choose. But you must ask the questions, and when you do, as one person said, “read reality truthfully”... why would people from those countries want so badly to come here, why is our economy so strong and favorable for the underdog, why does our country still stand out among the world’s leaders. And don’t you think they know that? That is why the undercurrent of liberalism has so eroded the foundation of thought and freedom and in our younger generations. Please read reality truthfully in light of history, in light of other countries downfalls and in light of people who have made the mistake of believing the lies of those who thirst after more power and control at the expense of the people. We personally have friends that have come out of communism (that have their basis in socialist ideals) in Cuba, Poland, and Russia. We have heard their experiences and why they came here, some for religious freedom, some for economic freedom, some for other freedoms. You say I keep posting blatant falsities, I could make blanket statements like that as well, but that is the way of liberal browbeating and you are better than that. Don’t sink to generalized blanket statements intended to shame and push people into silence. It is not good discussion decorum nor will it work in my case. And maybe you didn’t intend it that way, but just know I see it a lot and it is easy for people to slip into without realizing it. And how can you use one main stream media source to disprove another? Unfortunately main stream media sources are blantaly biased and will continue to push whatever agenda they want, not truth. They tout whatever their leadership wants people to believe (check The NY Times ex-employee letter that circulated recently). I truly wish there was unbiased media source, but by and large it that is a thing of the past. But if you watched the video, the anchor makes a great comment at the end. Every American should be concerned about the security and integrity of our system. I guarantee if Biden’s team saw the same things happening, not only would everyone be up in arms, but you would have also seen Antifa at work. And that will happen when it is overturned. Remember this, when it is overturned and legitimate votes are counted, the media will say it is all false and the riots will start again. the beauty in our current system is this, our constitution gives you the freedom to hate it. Just like God loves people so much, they can live eternity without Him if they choose. And people can push for legation that takes that freedom away (again I go back the beginnings of this in thought policing) but there are those of us who want to preserve the freedoms we have and love our country.

Because I'm sorry Gary Johnson got over 4 million votes and this year we ended up losing MILLIONS of voters. There is no other way to look at this than potentially the biggest blown opportunity and a fuck up of apocalyptic proportions. We are a country on a suicide mission. The right and left are too busy yelling at each other about nonsense to realize we are spending ourselves into oblivion with foreign war, massive social welfare programs and too big to fail corporatism. 

I think the Jorgenson campaign went wrong in a few places. The BLM support. You immediately turned off 50% of the country with this stance. Dare I say the 50% of the country we have a significantly higher chance of converting. So that was a downright failure. 

This could be a part b to my first reason but the following up with all this woke crap. I get the trying to bridge the gap and pull people from both sides. But who the hell actually thinks we are going to convert these wackjob leftists running around like orange man is hitler. Yes we may be able to grab those 80s democrats and center leaning ones but they hate the woke shit too. The Dave Rubin and justin straka crowd all walked away because of that shit. Now we are like oh we are so woke and anti racist and they look at us because they clearly have an open mind but once Jo said that shit they all said yeah sorry I'm trying to get away from this shit. 

Another thing was the we want america to be like Switzerland. Armed and neutral. While as a libertarian I get what she is trying to say. Dare I say it even makes sense. But  now think about this in terms of attracting new voters ( which is what we HAVE to do) you say that and the tight looks at you like ""what? We are fucking America!"" So immediately once again they now think we are a joke. And the left goes ""Switzerland"" we like Denmark or Norway. So once again not turning any heads. 

My final point is Jo was just a bad messenger. Very little charisma. She seemed tone deaf to the moment a lot of times. It wasnt like she never had air time and didnt get on any shows. Granted Rogan voted for her and we couldnt get an appearance on his show? Like come on how the fuck was that not priority number 1?

Anytime I see someone say something even remotely republican-esc, they have negative votes on the comment. This goes for basically every subreddit I’ve been on. It’s even harder to find other libertarians on here. Anytime I say something that doesn’t exactly line up with the lefts ideas/challenges them, I just get downvoted into hell, even when I’m just stating a fact. That or my comment magically disappears. This is extremely frustratingly for someone who likes to play devil’s advocate, anything other than agreeing marks you as a target. I had no idea it was this bad on here. I’ve heard that a large amount of the biggest subreddits on here are mainly controlled by a handful of people, so that could also be a factor in this. 

Edit: just to clear this up, in no way was this meant to be a “I hate liberals, they are so annoying” type of post. I advocate for sensible debate between all parties and just happened to notice the lack of the right sides presence on here(similar to how Instagram is now)so I thought I would ask you guys to have a discussion about it. Yes I lean towards the right a bit more than left but that doesn’t mean I want to post in r/conservative because they are kind of annoying in their own way and it seems to not even be mostly conservative.

Also a lot of you are talking about the age demographic playing a major role which makes sense.

This is NOT the end goal of Libertarian thought. 
The end goal is preservation of Liberty. 

When conservative hell holes, like Oklahoma, made it a literal felony for a white person to marry a black person, it’s a violation of freedom of association.
The 10th Amendment people don’t want to do anything about this, which betrays them as fauxbertarians, because they don’t actually care about liberty as a principle. 

The federal government eventually had to step in and correct Oklahoma. The federal government was the *only* thing that corrected injustice within that state. The federal government is absolutely necessary for these reasons.

To elaborate further, in general it seems to be understood that despite the provisions of the second amendment (setting aside the Well Regulated Militia clause and the originalist reading of 2a having bear arms meaning the use of arms in a military sense), some restrictions we all seem to gloss over across the political spectrum are some restrictions we seem to agree (for the most part) are common sense. Most wouldn't want random citizens having quick and easy unregulated access to military grade explosives, claymore mines, artillery cannons, or a nuclear warhead. However the NRA, Conservatives, and some Libertarians (I say some because I have heard some of my Libertarian friends say that they believe that all arms even high end military hardware should also be protected by the 2a) seem to only start drawing the line at restrictions on automatic rifles. This has always left me confused because as I see it you shouldn't really be allowed to pick and choose just how far a right extends, either we should have unfettered access to weapons and military hardware (arms) as that is all the 2a says, or they should have reasonable restrictions which are arbitrary based on our values as a nation at the time, you can't really have both without it seeming hypocritical.

This sub is full of people from all points of the political compass, all here because on some level they're curious about libertarianism.

That means occasionally they're going to engage with you, and debate you, and that's when it's your job to reward their curiosity by presenting evidence that libertarianism and classic liberalism have merit as an approach.

Rage-posting about how you can't just get praised for your opinion is not just childish, it's counter-productive. You're arguing for an echo chamber! (Often by claiming reddit is an echo chamber.)

Mods - I'd like to submit for consideration that we should not allow top-level posts that claim that reddit or especially this subreddit is ""like this"" or ""like that"" or ""changing for the worse because of [insert ideology]"". 

We should force people to post in a way that starts productive conversations about libertarian ideas. Threads about how pure the sub is are worthless and distract from the real value that can sometimes be found here.

In short: make /r/libertarian an anti-circle-jerk zone. Please. The constant gatekeeping getting exhausting, and the exact opposite of how to spread a philosophy.",2

I know this is controversial but I think this is the best way to get 3rd party representation. I have seen contrasting views on this issue but no posts as I have scrolled through the subreddit.

But my view is this. Your vote shouldn't be part of blue or red. However, if you don't vote to empowerment yourself then you will forever be red or blue or a sliver within the pie chart. It's a case of pragmatism vs morals. The journey shouldn't end with your vote now, but your vote 10, 20, 30 years in the future.

For example, it's clear the democratic party is a coalition of different political views but if given a chance, they will splinter and provide themselves the chance to empower their representation.

Socialists make the argument that the ""free trade"" imposed by WTO, World Bank, IMF etc are bad for the developing countries and the developed ones today are basically choosen winners by the west.

I mean it's true, all countries were protectionist to some degree.

South Korea had(still have?) Five-Year Plans under dictatorship and their government picked up winners and formed oligopolies, Japan was really interventionist and had basically single party and protected domestic industries and slowly exposed them to global competition.


China too is following same trend. Same with Vietnam.

 I think all the these countries incentivised economies of scale, large corporations basically, heavily favoured them and then later asked them to compete globally.

The only deviation I see is that of Chile, but the reforms were also carried under brutal dictatorship of Gen Pinochet, kinda sponsored by CIA. And we can't really ignore their copper deposits. Chile's miracle was more like copper miracle imo. even today half of their export is copper and copper related stuff.



So my question is, did these countries got rich by regulated capitalism or inspite of it? Ofcourse I'm on r/libertarian so you guys will say the later, but just want to hear some interesting perspectives on this.

4,68,1263,203,"A question for Libertarians: what do you feel is the role of government in combatting the power and influence of corporations. So obviously Libertarian thought objects to oversized government power structures, but is there a similar objection to corporate power?

If so how should corporate power be restrained, and does the government have a role in that restraint?

As an example in California we recently had another round of propositions go through. Two props in particular were subject to massive corporate lobbying and as campaigns. Prop. 22 (which would have granted uber drivers and other gig economy workers more benefits) saw over $200,000 in corporate lobbying expenditure, while Prop. 23 (which would have placed some regulation on dialysis clinics and required clinics to offer the same care independent of a patients wealth) saw over $100,000 in spending by the companies profiting off of dialysis. As a result the position funded by the corporations won the vote.

I also think that things like healthcare and college tuition absolutely need their cost to be brought down through government intervention and I support people like AOC and Bernie because they also support these things. I generally like any government policy that is meant to help people that are less well off.

This KEEPS the free market elements of a (mainly) undistorted market but also addresses the economic externality that greenhouse gas emissions poses. For those who don't know, cap-and-trade is basically a system that caps total greenhouse emissions and allows companies to bid for permissions to pollute.

0,17,1957,348,"Libertarianism is Anarchist... Wait, no. Communist. Inspired by our good friend r/juvenile_josh, let me take a moment to support his argument: AOC is not a Libertarian, but not because she's Socialist, but because she isn't Communist or Anarchist enough. 

Libertarianism was born from the throughs of the Enlightenment era, where Kings and Emperors ruled over peasants in either totality or via a governing force that pushed the rulers and their own will upon the lower classes.  Then enter the English and their Civil War, and John Locke dropping this bomb:

Property is a right, derived from the value of the labor produced upon it. 

Don't worry, John Locke wasn't libertarian, he just laid the very foundations for libertarian values to prosper. It was our good friend William Godwin who truly gave a voice to Libertarianism. A summary of his work can be distilled to:

The state is there to make us happy and to prevent injustice, but it does the opposite. As such, the state is pointless, and we should govern ourselves to the best of our ability, with all property, goods, and land being used by those who need it. 

This was followed up by the logical conclusion of Liberalism, Anarchism. The state is evil, humans must be free at all costs, and you take what you need while ensuring happiness growth for yourself and who you care about. A classical Utopia if ever there was one.

We're almost done, but we haven't talked about the man, the myth, the legend Joseph Déjacque yet. Joe here had this crazy idea: We all produce what we want to produce, at our ability, and share it as we see fit. He came up for a term for what he was and his beliefs: He was a Libertarian. The first Libertarian was a Communist.

That's right, you're all a bunch of dirty Commies and you should be ashamed. Good day.

1,29,6371,1089,"I am working on a project that I think will give libertarians their best shot at substantial political representation. 

I think that everyone who is looking for major political change has the right attitude of course, but lacks a reasonable, finite plan. So I am here today to provide that for you. 

As of August 24th, I Started what is currently being called the Votebreaker SuperPAC. 

For now that is only in name. I’m not collecting money, I’m not campaigning in the traditional sense. I’m not a large company or anything, I’m just a guy with an idea. 

But by Election Day 2024, I will be working my ass off to convince between 1.5 and 2.5 million people in Florida, North Carolina, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, 300k each, to vote together, not to endorse a specific candidate that we all love, but to use the objective leverage that we as a large disillusioned group objectively have, to threaten the Democratic and Republican parties(by way of the DNC, RNC, and other relevant groups) with a win from the opposing party, unless they bow to some very specific concessions made by the SuperPAC. This will firstly be in the form of Cash, but also in an effort to bring about the end of first past the post voting, gerrymandering, ending the electoral college, and other political issues, to siphon as much money and power out of big politics as possible. 

The name of the game here is creating leverage. 

The 5 states mentioned above are swing states, the average margin of win in all 5 is under 300k votes in each. With these numbers, it is very possible to throw those states collective 80 electoral votes, enough to decide an election mind you, into whichever direction the group so chooses. (This can be done with other states in various combinations, but these are the easiest 5.)

We’re not going to win any elections, but we’re not trying to.

 With those numbers, we have more than enough power to completely upend the electoral process with just a little bit of coordination between you, and other anti establishment and third party voters (or previously non voters as the case may be)
You have a common goal, no matter how much you hate any other particular third party philosophy. 

There is too much money in politics and too much money in the two party system. You may have ideological differences with other third party members, but in order to progress, your starting point is the same. 

The SuperPAC itself is simply a vehicle for collecting and distributing the money in a Transparent way for everyone to see. 

The money collected, which will be demanded from candidates, other PACs, and other big money supporters, will be mostly given away or otherwise spent on a neutral as possible, public good project to be decided in the near future. 

But this is again to create leverage to level the political playing field in the form of major policy change.  

The only way to get Elites to pay attention to you is to Affect their ability to generate cash. So let’s do that. 


This plan takes advantage of a few loopholes. 

Firstly; buying and selling votes at the individual level is explicitly illegal. 

However, directing blocks of voters with suggestions is just electioneering. Plain and simple. (Legally, this is also explicitly not extortion. I have done my homework and every step of this plan is legal.)

Essentially, as the operator of the Votebreaker superPAC, after gathering the appropriate amount of people and attention, I and my team of people who help me operate will publicly declare, across  the official social media accounts and as many other sources as I can, that the representatives of the Democratic and Republican parties that we choose have a choice. 

Pay X amount of dollars, in the form of a payment towards an official endorsement in conjunction with FEC guidelines, or the collective vote will go to the other party. 

Let’s say the amount is $60 million. 

If neither party participates, choose a party at random. They will receive the collective vote at every level of government for every election, so as to force the opposing party to pay. 

If one party pays, they get the collective vote. 

If both party’s pay, the vote is neutralized. 

In order to demonstrate that we are as numerous and powerful and coordinated as we say we are, we can’t simply not vote in that election. 

So to demonstrate that we have real voting power, a neutral unaffiliated third party name will be written in, not as a legitimate candidate, but simply to bypass the secret ballot, and publicly acknowledge the groups numbers. We will collectively vote for that name instead. 

Individual votes are anonymous. Groups of votes however are publicly tracked and tallied every Election Day.  

And that is the gist of the project. A simple, non violent, accelerationist option. 

Do not consider this project to be one that works against your own interests. 

That would be the case if I was looking to mobilize say, the entire Democratic Party, which makes up 25% of the population. 

But what I am asking for is the support of less than half a percent of you. That is literally all it takes. That is how unstable the US political system is. 

Over the next four years I will be working towards creating public service announcements and the like In order to draw attention to this. 

Anyone with applicable skills and suggestions are encouraged to contact me and support with your talent or your vote (and not your money) as you are able. Eventually, this culminates in an app that makes the coordination effort significantly easier.

There are multiple tactical considerations to consider for all sorts of reactions that people may have to this project, but many of those have already been considered, and are waiting to be enacted. 

Again, The name of the game here is creating a type of leverage that the majority of people are scared of, but that people in power will have a hard time ignoring. All for the greater good. 

I look forward to hearing from all of you, and garnering support, chiefly by getting people with technical talent or resources that I may use, significant writing skill, familiarity with OSINT, social media prowess, and anything short of that, simply following along and pledging support and spreading the word. 

Come join us over at r/votebreaker. Time is running out. Please spread the word.",2

Heads up: I'm a dirty lib-left/lib-center that's just trying to get some perspective. I was having a discussion about gun violence and I feel like a lot of this discussion around control or freedom isn't really based on numbers or facts a lot of the time. I don't really want to own guns but I don't really feel threatened by people who have them and aren't being careless with them.   


I just want gun violence to happen less. or just happen less to people innocent people with things like mass shootings I guess. I'm not convinced that regulating guns is the best idea but maybe if guns are just legal no questions asked, maybe there should be more research on gun violence and a more robust access to education on handling guns?  maybe gun violence isn't even that big of a problem?   


So if someone brings up the subject of gun violence and talks about mass shooters in schools and stuff as a way to talk about gun regulation like background checks and mental health screening (which I don't really support completely) what's your response to that conversation?

Housing prices are skyrocketing in coastal cities. And rather than increase wages and housing supply, we just tell the poor to get fucked. So they move to cheaper states, increasing pressure on other areas for resources. Wages are stagnating while housing, education, and healthcare are becoming out of reach. And all of this is what is driving populism on the right and left. And this is going to become a threat to democracy and liberty because people will turn to more authoritarian, drastic measures in order to restore some sort of sense of security - even if it means getting rid of freeom.

Yes, this election was a very divisive one, and yes JoJo was not given the opportunities needed for a successful campaign, but to me those are just surface level issues, not the root cause. She got about 50% of the votes that Gary Johnson got in 2016, even after he repeatedly embarrassed himself.

So to me, here's the problem. It's not that people don't know what Libertarianism is, or are blind to the many, many faults of government, it's just that libertarian ideas seem impossible. There are virtually no examples of a society which successfully implemented the ideas of Liberty in the modern era. Instead the most modern and successful countries are moving more and more towards authoritarianism. We're stuck in a Catch-22: people won't take us seriously because we don't have practical examples, and we don't have practical examples because people won't take us seriously.

All of this is to say, given the result of the election, about 1% of the US population is actually Libertarian (2016 was a fluke because of the quality of the candidates). 1% of the population generally can't achieve anything. For those who will bring up the revolutionary war, I'll remind you that the leaders of those 3% who participated were among the wealthiest, best educated, and most powerful people in North America. They bankrolled the revolution, and it would have failed to launch had they not been involved.  I don't see Elon, Bill Gates, or Jeff Bezos joining our cause any time soon.

The issue with the Libertarian party, and our general approach to politics, is the assumption that once we have elected officials, they can use their platform to spread the message (like Ron Paul did). I believe that at this point most of the people who can be convinced just by rhetoric, have been convinced. The only way to move forward is by example.

In my home state of New Hampshire, after the last election, approximately 40% of the State House is now Libertarian or Libertarian leaning. The Republicans have a very slight majority, but it's very small. This means that basically nothing will get passed without the Liberty block. Additionally New Hampshire went very blue/authoritarian in the DC level elections (I'm not saying democrats are more authoritarian than Republicans by default, just that our representatives happen to be quite ""progressive"").

Yes, almost all of the members of the Liberty block ran and were elected as Republicans, but knowing many of them personally, I can say that they are literally as Libertarian as it comes. These amazing State House results were achieved with only \~5000 movers to New Hampshire (many of whom aren't politically active). Image what could be done if 50k people moved.",2

Has anybody been calling for lessened border restrictions since they were tightened post-9/11?  Is this something that could happen in the foreseeable future?

---
*Pros:*

Huge economic incentive for business, travel, commuting

Unrestricted cross-border travel seems more free

We already have a similar quality-of-life, development level, and regulations so theoretically unchecked immigration, loss of manufacturing, and such should not be a huge issue.  

There are lots of cross-border towns, businesses, and travel corridors that got messed up with increasing border control, particularly post 9/11 changes.  Customs can take hours.

NAFTA/Trump-NAFTA already exists for the free flow of goods mostly so why not have the free flow of people

???

---

*Cons:*

Birthright citizenship in the US.  Anyone born here is automatically a citizen so people coming from or traveling in Canada could just have their kid here.  Most countries that had this at one point have recently gotten rid of it, but this has been extremely beneficial for the US in the past.  From what I understand this would require a constitutional amendment to change.

Canadian gun laws are more restrictive

Different drugs are smuggled either way across the border as a result of the war on drugs

Terrorism - The US has insane border control post 9/11 due to the terrorism concerns.  Personally I think we overreacted far too much to 9/11 and most of our increased security measures do little to actually help

Different regulations for business - we already have NAFTA/Trump-NAFTA, so I don't see why open flow of people would cause any issues with businesses shutting down or moving across the border due to environmental regulations or whatever.

???

---

*Other thoughts:*

Coming from an American POV, did I miss any reasons why the Canadians would not want an open border?  Are there any Canadians who want less restrictions on the border as it is?

Would making US and Canadian anti-terrorism controls comparable be difficult or unreasonable?

How do Schengen-area countries deal with different gun, drug, labor, and environmental regulations?  I guess you can just get in deep $hit with the police if they find out you brought illegal stuff across the border?

Is birthright citizen a big obstacle to this?  If so, could it realistically be modified to make this work?

Why are our international borders with Canada still shut for COVID?  The thing has already spread everywhere across the continent, its not like its going to transmit more if people travel across the border.

The war on drugs seems to be slowly drawing to an end.  Does this make lessened border restrictions and faster customs in North America more likely?

Regardless of your overall opinion on Joe Biden, would he be likely to reinstate or change trade agreements such and the TPP, NAFTA, or the Cuban thaw?

Do you see North America moving more towards less restricted borders in the near future?  Is there anything the Libertarian party can do to push to this end?

???

Another group was discussing either leasing or purchasing land in a foreign country to act as an independent entity, the biggest hurdle was as of what I had read most of the countries willing to do this were not entirely known for honoring agreements, and there was a real fear of it being taken away either once set up or if it was successful. 

Another of a politician attempting to carve out a section of the city and have it be run on libertarian principals, still having to pay taxes to the state but able to govern independently. Finally I had heard about purchasing islands to do the same, this sounded to me like ideal selection.

The best examples of this I can think of are California, Colorado, and Florida where the populations are heavily segmented and diverse (not speaking as color of skin rather than culturally).  Additionally, states do not currently fulfull the role of being small nations, but do add an extra layer of bureaucracy giving you none or few of the benefits of having an under-powered state government with all the pain in the ass.

Ideally, my solution would be for policy to be handled by the federal government, and local laws/regulations to be handled at the county level.  I've also never really understood why there is county government AND city government when many cities and counties are redundant in nature.

To my understanding into this, 35 states still have some form of certificate of need laws. What is the easiest way in any market to reduce prices? 

Having increased competition in the market allows individuals and companies to compete with the best product and the best service at the best price. 

The current health system in Kentucky does not allow for any actual competition, or allow you to decide which health insurance you can purchase inside the state or where you may seek treatment. 

Health insurance should be as easy to buy as it is to purchase your car insurance.

Insurance should be a free and open market that allows people to purchase the plan that best suits their needs. 

Additionally, we have certificate of need laws in the state. 

Our current certificate of need laws have their roots in the mid-70s during the formation of Medicare and Medicaid.

The federal government told every state if you want to receive your Medicaid and Medicare funding, you will need to have the certificate of need laws as a regulation in your state.

Ten years later, they realized that the entire theory behind it that more competition was causing prices to rise was utterly wrong. 

They recommended every state immediately tear up the doctrine as it was a failed policy. 

Over 30 years later and Kentucky still uses certificate of need laws to grant private monopolies inside the state, removing the ability for others to compete for your business.

Certificate of need allows for a single conglomerate to be propped up by the state and legally monopolize the health care services for your area.

As your representative, I will work to repeal the entire certificate of need doctrine in the state of Kentucky and open the insurance market to allow for competition to offer you the people the best possible choices for you and your family.",2

Simply put, what else would they do? If they didn't support Trump, they'd effectively be supporting the democrats because America has become a two party system. 

While the actions of the Republican party are reprehensible, it's totally understandable that they wouldn't want to voluntarily surrender power to the democrats.  

If a crazed democrat took over and tried to act as authoritarian as Trump, they'd all line up behind him too. Because to do otherwise is to surrender to the other team. 

Also a result of the president having far too much power. If the issues that enabled Trump are not corrected, someone just like him can take over. And they may not be as dumb about it as he was.

The general idea is that municipalities would own and operate their own server networks and would provide a sort of ""intranet"" for their locality. The security protocols would all be open source and publicly available and any resident of the locality could be issued an IP address just like they get a postal address.

The primary advantage that I see is that these intranets could be set up so that everyone accessing the wider internet from them could inherently have their data protected by high quality internet security protocols that might not be practical for each individual but could make sense at municipal scale. One source of funding could be the sale of aggregated and anonymized data for the whole municipality, and its possible that individuals could choose to sell their personal data and then pay a service fee for the internet access.

Another benefit is that they could host actually useful social networks where neighbors could safely communicate online with much less risk of data theft and not accounts. People could more comfortably use their real names in these spaces, knowing they are interacting with community members and not out in some amorphous global community.

Municipal business like county board, city counsel, school board, etc.. Meetings could be hosted on these platforms, or at least they could be a place for submission of comments and the recording of minutes.

They could also serve as digital city halls where residents could check in on the governmental goings on and communicate with various departments (I know that's basically what current municipal websites are, I'm just imagining a more comprehensive and functional version).

I think it fits with the libertarian ethic because it could shift the paradigm to one in which our digital person is inherently protected through municipal infrastructure just like our physical person is. It could potentially foster a more vibrant civic life by eliminating many of the hurdles that working people face in engaging the governmental process and by eliminating the anonymity that breeds toxicity online around many public policy topics. I think that people often are pushed toward accepting supporting government over reach because they are afraid of others and feel disempowered within the system of governance.

1,216,8205,1222,"People here don't understand libertarian socialism Including many of the libertarian socialists here. I'll try to clarify what libertarian socialism is by clearing up some common misconceptions  about it

**Myth 1: Libertarian socialism is a contradiction in terms**

This is a very common attitude that emerges from the general understanding of socialism which essentially is ""socialism is when the government does stuff"" and the understanding of libertarianism which essentially is ""Libertarianism is the marriage of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism"". This characterization is clearly incorrect or at the very least incomplete in both cases. On the point of socialism, this is best describes as the umbrella term for economic systems and ideologies wherein the productive forces of society are collectively owned and controlled, as opposed to privately owned and controlled. It has nothing to do with taxes or government size (the first nation to abolish taxes had a socialist economy). For a practical example of one sort of socialist system, I direct your attention to revolutionary Catalonia. Here a confederation of revolutionary labor unions gained control of factories, shops and other economic centers of society, replacing the barons who used to own them. These unions then democratically planned the economy confederally. This is an example of socialism, not Bernie sanders style social democracy. The term libertarian was historically invented by anarchist communist (a subcategory of libertarian socialist) Joseph Dejacque in his critical letter to Proudhon to describe his own ideology, meaning that the current characterization of libertarianism while valid in its own right, is a deviation from the word's original meaning. 

**Myth 2: Libertarian Socialism is Social Democracy with a high degree of civil liberty and a focus on worker cooperatives**

While the previous misunderstanding comes from the right, this particular vulgarization comes primarily from confused left leaning liberals. I blame the god awful political compass for this confusion. This view is ahistorical. While libertarian socialists are almost uniformly in favor of LGBTQ+ rights, racial and gender equality, gun rights etc this is not enough to make one a libertarian outside of the context of the political compass. Those are cultural and civil, not political views. After all, most contemporary Marxist Leninists also are in favor of those same things, but they are not libertarian. So then what is the distinction? Attitudes towards the distribution of power. The Marxist Leninist tradition is authoritarian because it seeks to centralize power in a pyramidal/hierarchical structure. What characterizes the libertarian socialist tradition is that it seeks to decentralize power. For a practical example of this principles, lets examine the political program of the late Murray Bookchin, libertarian municipalism in contrast with Marxist Leninism. 

The ML political program's distinguishing trait is the vanguard party which makes decisions according to the principle of 'democratic centralism'. This means that the worker's councils which compose the party at the local level would select representatives, who would then be sent to select a leader at the representative level, who would then go on and democratically select a rep for the next highest level, until they eventually reach the highest or national level. While local decisions would be made by the local council, regional decisions would be made by the regional representatives, etc all the way up until the national levels are made by the national representative. There is a clear centralizing of power here. Libertarian municipalism's most basic unit is the confederation of communes, wherein each is governed by directly democratic citizens assemblies. In this system, each commune would come to its own decisions through democracy much like the leninist worker's councils. The difference occurs on the higher levels. In libertarian municipalism, this is how national scale decisions would be made:1. each local citizens assembly would decide on an action through participatory democracy (either consensus or majoritarian). 2. These assemblies would select an immediately recallable delegate to express the decision of the commune at the regional level with the other communal delegates in the region. 3. The delegates would return to their respective communes to relay the decisions of the other communes, wherein another decision would be reached through the citizens assemblies, before the delegate is sent back to the regional council. 4. After a decision is reached between all the regional communes, the a single delegate from among the group is chosen and this process repeats itself at the higher level. Even at the highest level, these decisions must always be passed by the communes. With that said, libertarian municipalism would seek to localize decision making to prevent the centralizing tendencies of mass society from re-emerging. 

Thus, the libertarianism of libertarian socialism refers to its attitude towards centralization, not neccesarily its attitude towards civil struggles such as the LGBTQ+, women's, racial, etc liberation movements, although the two are closely related for reasons that will be highlighted later in this post.

**Myth 3: Libertarian Socialism is synonymous with anarchism/anarchist communism/anarchist syndicalism**

This misconception is more conceivable than the other two historically speaking. Libertarian socialism is umbrella term for decentralist socialist ideologies and movements throughout history. Without a doubt, the most prominent of these schools of thought have been those associated with anarchism. Anarchism is roughly the original political philosophy organized around the critique of hierarchy, in favor of mutual aid and cooperation. This analytical framework has been the backbone of the libertarian socialist movement for well over 150 years, as opposed to the state socialist ideologies that emerged from the Marxist analysis which focused on class instead of other forms of hierarchy. However, not all libertarian socialist ideologies are necessarily anarchist.  For example, the council communists and left communists who emerged from the Marxist tradition are certainly not anarchists due to their lack of any emphasis of hierarchy, but they are nonetheless libertarian due their emphasis on decentralized methods of organization. Even hierarchy focused schools of thought such as social ecology, are distinct from the anarchist tradition, though the distinctions there are a bit fuzzier.  It is the hierarchy based emphasis of social ecology and anarchism that makes both movements generally support the civil liberation movements of LGBTQ+ people, racial &amp; ethnic minorities, women etc along with the immediate abolition of the state. Council coms and left coms, following the Marxist definition of the state, believe in a revolutionary directly democratic dictatorship of the entirety of the proletariat  ( *Bakunin: The Germans number around forty million. Will for example all forty million be member of the government? Marx: Certainly! Since the whole thing begins with the self-government of the commune*) as a transition towards full communism. Suffice to say, while anarchism is certainly the most influential school of thought among the libertarian left, it is not the only one.

**Conclusion: So then what is libertarian socialism?**

I believe the definition of libertarian socialism emerges pretty clearly from the earlier statements. The way I see it, **libertarian socialism is the umbrella term for political ideologies that seek the collective ownership and control of the productive forces and civic institutions of society along decentralized lines.** 

Hopefully, after this post nobody will ever say ""iSn'T lIbErTaRiAn SoCiAlIsM cOnTrAdIcToRy"", again.

There are probably typos in here but I'm too lazy to fix them right now

**Tl;dr) libertarian socialism is the umbrella term for political ideologies that seek the collective ownership and control of the productive forces and civic institutions of society along decentralized lines.**",2

I also believe that you have the right to defend yourself or others if presented with an immediate threat to your health and safety. 

BUT in this country we punish crime through the judicial system, it's a process set up by laws all of which originate from our bill of rights, which is the first 10 amendments to our constitution. You are accused of a crime, you are presumed innocent until judged otherwise otherwise in a court of law by a jury of your peers.

Summary executions and extrajudicial murders circumvent this process it its entirety and apply punishments far greater than the crime calls for. They deny people 50% of their rights under the Bill of rights out founding fathers put to paper, and millions of people before us have died fighting for.

If you see someone stealing a toaster from Target, and you murder him, not only have you denied him his right to live you have denied him his 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th amendment rights granted to him by the constitution of this country.

1,65,3319,575,"Is there truth to the ""both sides"" argument? Every so often on this sub, a poster or commenter claims something along the lines of ""both sides of the duopoly are equally bad/the same."" Usually, they are downvoted to hell and are met with accusations of being Trump shills or at least failing to see how Trump is much worse than Biden. So today I'd like to examine the ""both sides"" argument to see if there's any truth in it. 

It's worth noting initially that people mean vastly different things when using the ""both sides"" argument. A lot of it has to do with short versus long-term outlook. 

Right now, in November 2020, it seems very foolish to say that Biden is having a worse impact on our country and libertarian principles than Biden, simply because Trump is in office and is in power. Any libertarian is right to constantly question those in power to ensure they don't abuse or expand their power. And with Trump, we've had plenty of things to critique when it comes to abuse and expansion of power. 

Thus, saying that ""Trump and Biden are equally bad"" is currently problematic because we've seen that Trump was a terrible president (he may have done a few things right but at the cost of many, many principles that us libertarians hold dearly). It's hard to say exactly how Biden will govern, so at worst comparing the two is comparing a known evil to a possible evil. In the short term, the ""both sides"" argument seems to sidestep the very real errors and villainy of the Trump administration.

But in the long term, comparing the stances of the Republican and Democrat parties since 2000, there is so much in common between them that the ""both sides"" claim makes a lot more sense. And, with a few exceptions, Trump and Biden have both toed the party line pretty consistently throughout their political careers. 

Both sides, and political figures, are strong supporters of the ""war on terror"", with no real plan to end it from either side and continued investment in the military industrial complex. Both have minimal if any solutions to the ""war on drugs."" Both recieve constant praise from one of CNN and Fox and constant attacks from the other. Both are in favor of bloated government spending with no plan to halt the growing debt crisis that threatens to engulf our country. 

Neither are tackling the aspects that are necessary for true police reform (ending qualified immunity, breaking up police unions, ending civil asset forfeiture, etc). Both are strong defenders of the free speech that perfectly aligns with their positions. Both sides are viewed as either anti-american or a bulwark against an evil ideology by alternate pluralities of the nation. 

Thus, saying ""both sides are equally bad"" in terms of the suite of key policy positions both sides have taken over tha past two decades is accurate in my opinion. Emphasizing this point shows people who are independent or simply not drinking the kool-aid of their party that the solution to the duopoly's issues will not be found inside the duopoly itself (at least in its current state). 

If anything, I think that using this argument in conversation to call for the abolition of the electoral college in favor of ranked choice voting could be a good way to go. Thoughts?

I think this community already does a better job than most. Wouldn't it be great if we had a r/politics that held all different kinds of views and not just the left wing position?

I wasn't always the best at accepting others with differing views, and I have really only just recently started to make amends with friends and family that I essentially shut off because of my pretty strong libertarian values. Especially in the age of misinformation and a president who is subverting the legitimacy of our entire electoral process, we need to remember the individuality and humanity of every person in this country (and world). What comes from the opposite of this are horrible ideologies of violence and hate.

I've been thinking about this a lot and I don't want to sound pretentious or all hippy when I say ""just love everybody mannnn"" but that really should be the mentality we take up. You don't have to love or even like somebody. You just have to respect that people will have different values and political stances.

Given that, is it defensible for a libertarian to vote for candidate A and still feel like they're *fighting the good fight* (or something)?  Isn't the right thing to do, considering our shared principles, to push back on the expansion of government in the most effective way possible?

1,3,1057,174,"Netflix is Libertarian As I was watching the Snowden dramatization, I felt the need to cover all of my cameras and put my phone in the microwave. The production of this film carried strong themes of anti-big government including anti-FISA, one of the biggest encroachments on the American population (and foreign populations too). 

I saw the same anti-big government theme in the Waco dramatization where Netflix chose to portray the Branch Davidian’s as more innocent and the ATF as an insanely militarized and overpowered force. They portrayed the Ruby Ridge incident in a similar fashion. This is the same perspective I share as a libertarian, and I personally think the ATF should be abolished. However, a company the size of Netflix must hold a string conviction to portray that story in that way even when the true story is hotly contested. 

These are only two examples of libertarianism in the sea of Netflix productions. Does this theme carry through other Netflix productions? If so, could Netflix be a libertarian organization, or am I mistaken?",2

Now this may be kind of expensiv so I got a plan: everyone should have to give some money from their salaries each year.

Some of our representatives may end up being bastards.

**City council**- They have the real power over your life whatever the state does not do is a power of the city/town and they can affect everything from housing codes, to noise pollution, remember the legislature makes the laws.

**Coroner**- Them and the medical examiners have the power to investigate the police. If they feel like a shooting was unjustified they can hold the police accountable. Its hard for a prosecutor to do nothing when evidence is clear.

**Local Prosecutor**- They often decide what crimes go in front of a judge and jury. They can decide if they can stop unjust laws from being used against the people. If you have a corrupt one you can run against them *if you have the qualifications* if not find someone who will.

**State AG** They are the top they can ruin lives or help lives, and they are the ones most likely to get rid of corrupt officials.

If you have a judge sending people to jail for accidently voting when they were not allowed or throwing parents in jail over an once of weed then they need to go. Corruption is running just as rampant through the judicial system as the LEO system.

**Commissioner**- They are in charge of making sure everything is going well financially

**Board of Education/Super Intendant**- They can make or break a school district. If your school district is shit, you can run and fix it.

**State Auditor**- The corruption killer a good one can bust greedy politicians.

**State Treasurer**- If you are wondering where the fuck all the money your state supposedly has, has gone you need to get a new one.

The next 70 will be very dangerous, and even though it'll probably work out in the end, and President-Elect Biden will be certified at the Electoral College and sworn in, if things do go south, I hope you won't hesitate to stand with us. We will welcome you. I served in the Air Force for 6 years. I deployed to Iraq. I know about integrity, service before self, and excellence, and right now we need patriots of those qualities if we want this experiment in democracy to see a 245 year. 

Afterwards we'll argue about social differences as brothers and sisters, and in a manner that would make our Founders proud. 

One last thing, we have a Republic, ""if we can keep it"". It's time for us to keep it.

1,18,2973,482,"Libertarian view on financially challenged people Hi! 

I'm fairly new to libertarianism and i'm not sure how much ideas below are within the ideology, but maybe you can help me figure it out? 

 In my opinion there are three categories of financially challenged people:

\- those who work to their best ability but unable to generate income for decent lifestyle either due to lack of skills (and consequentially low productivity), tough job market, or unfair compensation.  

\- those who for reasons out of their control can't work or productivity of their work is limited (disabled, elderly); 

\- those who simply don't want to obtain skills or work;

Let's assume that issues for the first group can naturally be addressed by free market. That includes effectively addressing case of low skilled but ""investable"" individuals who after proper education can generate income sufficient to repay cost of education while living a decent life.  

Issues with second group can be addressed with insurance. That includes insurance (by parents?) of  children in case of birth defects or otherwise natural inability to be educated/productive. And if everybody doing their due diligence to prepare for retirement, elderly should be fine (assuming they are not in first category but that should be solved along with issues for first category). 

However since retirement contributions are voluntary, there may be individuals who consciously chose not to, and after becoming unable to work are left with no means to sustain themselves. 

Or parents are unable/unwilling to get birth insurance and person is being born unable to be productive, while being (unwillingly) uninsured;

These two sub-cases of second group, as well as third group is really what I'm having a problem with. 

Let's address uninsured birth case first because it s probably less common and has very controversial component to it (something along ""if prospect mother can't get insured she can't give birth"" lines). Let's for simplicity assume this insurance can be part of medical bill, and is subpart of healthcare affordability (which is subpart of people being financially challenged problem that funnels it back into one of aforementioned categories). 

So I'm really left with two types of people - those who are unwilling to work or those who are unwilling to contribute towards possible disability or aging. Eventually they will get into a state of immediate need of food or housing, and society has to foot the bill, meaning even while they are not immediately creating problems to anyone, by not acting they kind of do. For example, kids who don't want to study diligently creating deferred harm to society that will have to support them at loss. 

What is libertarian take on such people? If everybody is free to choose what to do with their time (including not getting marketable skills and not working even if they have ones) and money, how is society supposed to be protected from such behavior?",2

1,8,2017,372,"How is a 'small government' any different from a big one No matter which of the main two authoritarian parties you vote for (in whichever country you're in), the only difference between them is all about what they want to do in government. They go in with policy ABC vs policy XYZ, and you pick which one you hate least. Or you vote for another party with policy DEF or UVW...

Meanwhile, not a single one of those parties are ever going to gain the consent of the entire population they plan to rule over. It only works because the *rest* of the population grudgingly accept that the rules dictate that the winning part is in charge. They grumble, and they crab, but they hold on till next time, while they have their voices silenced and pushed out, and their interests sidelined.

There can be only one government, so there's an election and more people vote for one than vote for any other, so the winner wins, and fuck everyone else.

I fail to see how that situation would be any different with a small government. It's still a government, that still takes money from people who didn't vote for it to fund things those people presumably don't want (else they would have voted for it), just to enforce the whims of a majority.

To put it in America terms: at present, a majority vote D/R, every time. L and others are sidelined and ignored, because there can only be one winner, and that has to be the one with the most votes, so fuck you all sideways. I don't see it being any different if that majority winner was L. Still one winner. Still one government. Still taking people's money to fund a military and law en*force*ment

I, however, see it differently. I think that as long as even *one* person is not served by the result, as long as *one* person is paying for what they do not consent to, living under the boot of a regime they are not free to opt out of, the imposed hierarchy is illegitimate. Not overall; it has legitimacy with the people who *did* choose it, but it should not be forced upon others.",2

Just as an observer and someone that deals with the onslaught of Libertarian complaints in a real life government application, I want to say something.

Libertarians have a strong and principled foundation to their poltical beliefs, but from my experience they spend far more time railing against ""bad government"" than defining what government they believe should exist. 

As a politician this makes it incredibly difficult to gain the support needed for an election if you tried to run as an independent/Libertarian. Many Libertarians are the first people to viciously turn against a poltical candidate for a difference in some facet of their platform. 

For example, are Libertarians pro- local police or anti- local police? Or are Libertarians alright with funding local public-works projects like parks? If a private alternative isn't available will Libertarians accept a locally funded and controlled EMS? Are all taxes theft, even those adopted by a local millage vote? 

I'm all for open poltical debate and not having a monolithic set of views in a party, but can what I've asked be answered without a huge rift within the Libertarian party itself?",2

Perhaps removing so many convulsed government regulations on health care, that may be fixed, but even then I am in the form belief that health care is just something too important to be something for the markets to decide who can and can't afford it. 

I know it's contradictory to a libertarian belief set, so I wanted to ask people who've been here longer ,as I found the libertarian party  this year due to feeling neither of the main 2 parties support what I believe in.

And yet people who are selfish, stubborn, arrogant, ignorant, wont move away from the two parties at the national level. They won't even elect this third party in other states.

So as far as blaming us libertarians, the lesson is, that libertarian or third parties are the unreasonable choice, its a delusion, the real issue is even if a third party become reasonably electable these people would still stick their dichotomy, because for them its not about reasonable policy or reasonable outcomes, its a bloodsport.

I'm a proud, converted libertarian who voted for Jorgenson and used to be a member - and work for - another political party, but the party is woefully at management, branding/messaging, and strategy compared to the Big Two. Think about it:

-Libertarian voter registration is going up across the country. The party's share of the vote isn't.
-Libertarian candidates have been wildly unsuccessful, even at the local level.
-The party's policies are fairly clear, but candidates' messaging isn't. Ask any legit politician or GOP/Dem advisor - messaging is the key to winning campaigns. Libertarians have been abysmal at picking one clear, relatable message and hammering it home every chance they get.
-Media exposure. We're the 3rd largest party in the US, yet the mainstream media virtually never mentions or interviews libertarian candidates. The media is always looking for content - that's literally their job. It isn't hard to score an interview, particularly with local media outlets (I have done this for political candidates of a different party), so I don't see why libertarian candidates never seem to do this.
-Infrastructure. I can't really blame the party for failing to have the same type of organization, bench of candidates, training programs, etc. as the Big Two considering resource differential. But, at a minimum, the party should be able to do the easy stuff - registered voter databases and analytics of voter data to project where candidates are most likely to win, identification of strong candidates, training programs for candidates (covering messaging, fundraising, ground game, etc.), a staffer bank of reputable libertarian campaign staff, events/organizations meant to drive more young people into the party, etc.
-Money. Libertarians suck at raising money, which is ironic considering how many wealthy businesspeople - key donors to the GOP/Dems - are actually libertarians.
-Finding dedicated candidates at the local level. You don't build a party by solely running for president - you build a party by building a bench of local politicians and slowly and methodically getting those local politicians elected to state houses and in mayoral races, then getting them elected to House seats, etc.

I could go on, but I'm curious if others feel the same way. Also curious if other folks with political experience would be interested in collaborating to put together some sort of document/strategy guide for the national party and/or local parties to use.",2

1,4,2769,463,"Voted Libertarian last three Presidential Elections, party has become too dogmatic For about 11 years (16-27) I have been a devout Libertarian. I became obsessed with the ideology and the philosophy, mainly from Mill, Bastiat, Hayak, Rothbard and a few others. However in developing my deep convictions I realized that I've become disciple of ideological dogma and had no longer operated in the world of reality. 

I am still best captured by the Libertarian ethos, however I genuinely believe after being apart of another lackluster election cycle that the party needs to come back to reality. There is far too much hand waving on positions many hold such as ""abolish the fed"" even though the entire global economic system of literally every nation is currently predicated on debt based fiat currencies through fractal reserve banking. Yet there are many in this thread and within our intellectual circles who applaud those who say ""I'd abolish the Fed tomorrow"" as if this position is noble. Is it really in the best interest of the individual to crash the global market and geopolitical economy to uphold an ideological conclusion, even if that conclusion seems logical on principle. Do we not care about real world applications?

We must reconcile that Libertarians are an extremely wide range of individuals, there are many who do not fall into the religious zealotry of capitalism solves all woes. I genuinely believe going forward if our goal is to disrupt the centralized and corruption of the political elite and the corporatist who own them, we need to campaign on a platform that can put forward real policy solutions. We should hyperfocus on policy for achievable ideas that will have support from the population at large such as ending the war on drugs, reforming artificial market signals by the Fed, cutting red tape in healthcare to drive down costs, removing massive subsidies for big oil etc.

We need to accept that we will never win the Presidency until we have a faction within Congress which will not be achieved until we reach 5% of the Presidential vote. Which we can achieve if we, and have done in the past mainly through Ron Paul, nudge the conversations taking place in the country. Find common ground with people throughout the political spectrum and create innovative ways to tackle issues facing our nation. We have a real opportunity to build a 3rd party coalition that can bridge the polarization taking place in Government. We can capture the intellectual void currently weighing on the consciousness of our populace and do good by them. Or we can simply maintain the status quo of ideological zealotry that never surmonts to little outside of pat on the backs from purist achieving nothing but inflated egos from our own echo chamber.",2

I want to stress that this isn’t a sarcastic question, but in fact a very serious one. Long story short, I voted for Biden and while my friend said he did not vote (which I have zero qualms with whatsoever) he did support Trump, and given the choice, would have picked him over Biden. 

We had a long, but totally civil conversation that eventually boiled down to this. I had to acknowledge that not everyone who supports Trump is a racist, even if I believe that he is one. I know this because I know that my friend, who I’ve known for over a decade, is not racist at all. The reason I’m asking this question is because my friend said there is factual evidence that supports the opposite of Trump being racist and that he has actually done more for African-Americans than most presidents and that there isn’t any actual evidence that supports the notion that Trump is racist and that it’s what he has been labeled as by the media instead of who he actually is.

I know there is no one-size fits all check-box list for someone being a racist, but in my eyes someone not willing to condone white supremacy IS racist and not willing to piss off a large group of your supporters who are clearly actual racists says that you support racism.

1,9,3014,496,"NAP, Capitalism, Feudalism, and Questions from a Left-Libertarian Hey there. I am a young man from the United States, and I currently identify with left-libertarianism and am curious why most U.S. libertarians are right-leaning and/or support capitalism. So I am coming here to ask some good faith questions and see if I can understand you all better and perhaps build some solidarity together against unjust states. 

1.  The NAP, certainly the idea of the Non-Aggression  Principle seems good on the surface. It's essentially the golden rule and I generically agree with the concept. I know there is debate even among you about it's definition and boundaries. But with a super weak state, or no state at all, how can you enforce it without some sort of overbearing semi-militarized system? Especially with no or limited restrictions of armaments you would need a government that is just as well armed and powerful as it's most powerful citizen. Otherwise that most powerful citizen essentially can ignore the NAP with impudence. It seems to me that the consolidation of wealth via private property essentially makes a strong statist system inevitable if you actually care about the NAP. Because without some way of enforcement, the NAP is just a suggestion and cannot do anything. 

2. That leads me to my second question. What inherently makes capitalism and feudalism different? What makes the former acceptable but the latter wrong? If you look how companies, both corporate and not, operate and are organized the byzantine contracts and agreements remind me of the feudal contracts of ages past.  There is a parent company (a king) with many subsidiaries (vassals) and each has a certain responsibility to the other.  In feudal times it was taxes and levees the vassal would give to their lord in exchange for protection and access to the court. In modern times subsidiaries produce products in exchange for investment and the stability of being under a larger company. This is the era where the term landlord comes from. Peasants, who were free men and women, had to pay rent on the land they lived. And while they might not have liked it. It was the lord's private property and could do with it as he wished.  Now before serfdom, which was a type of slavery imo, is brought in. Remember that slavery has also existed in capitalist societies, such as the American south and Brazil. And often slavery still exists in the dark corners of capitalist societies. So what makes capitalism, in essence different than feudalism. Particularly since, admittedly this is an assumption, I believe most reading this believe that children have a right to inherit their parents belongings. 

So I guess it was more like 2 larger questions. And I hope to read responses soon! 

TL;DR: 

Q1. NAP + Capitalism = Need for strong state. 

Q2. Feudalism = Series of contracts among people inheriting private property.
Capitalism = Series of contracts among individuals and companies with individuals inheriting private property.",2

I have married a lovely lady who unfortunately has a Chrome's disease. Since then I have been turning over the idea on the law covering pre existing conditions and how I feel about it.

I have made up my mind and would like to get some opinions on what I rationed.

Right now if you want to acquire land you either buy it from the state or from someone who had previously bought it from the state, but without any state what system is in place for figuring out who gets what land?

One obvious sit is when it comes to roads and highways. Most ancaps figure corporations will build the roads and then charge tolls and this will circumvent the need for taxes. OK, but who gives the corporations the land to build the roads on? Is it first come first served? Because if that's the case what'd to stop me from running out and building my own 10 foot road with a toll booth right in the middle of someone's 1000 mile Highway? Or just waiting til the job is half done and building a giant ass wall for 10 miles and forcing the company to pay me an exorbitant amount of money to take it down and let them build? Is there a state that decides who gets to build what where? Doesn't that just defeat the whole purpose and destroy competition?

Also what about natural resources? Is that just first come first serve too? If you chop down a tree you get its lumber sounds kinda cool until you realise that creates a system where you have to deplete the natural resources as quickly as possible to stay competitive.

What about land for housing? It sounds cool just letting people walk into the wilderness and build their own home, but at what point does the land become yours? What's to stop me from just putting up a fence around hectares of land and charging stopping people from building there unless they buy it off me?

Or do we lit just have wild west style shootouts over land? Do private armies secure land for big corporations? That sounds terrifying, having Walmart deploy shock troops to kick you out of your home.

1,42,1871,292,"People who act like their fictional heroes are auth left annoy me. So many people use fictional heroes going against a dark lord to support their auth left agenda. Not just memes, but people will say this series/movie is obviously political because it involves them standing up to authority. As if Democrats aren't oppressive too. 

It's very obvious most fictional heroes fight for libertarian ideals. I struggle to think of fiction that involves trusting the government mindlessly, having wealth forcibly taken, and giving more power to the government. Almost all fictional heroes, from Buffy to Harry Potter to The Good Place, involve characters fighting for intrinsic rights. That's libertarian ideology, not socialism. 

Hell, the single most hated character in Harry Potter is a government official overstepping her boundaries and inserting government agenda onto an educational system. 

Or they try and cite Star Trek. In Star Trek, society works together to accomplish mutual goals. I can see how at first glance this can be seen as a leftist utopia. But in actuality, it's a libertarian paradise. People have a collectivist mindset, but it's voluntary. There's no evidence that the Federation statists forcibly take and redistribute resources. Picard is allowed to own a vineyard that certainly exceeds a socialist ideal of ""each to their need"". Sisko owns a restaurant voluntarily. They're post scarcity and cooperative, but nobody forces them to do anything. 

People like to pretend their heroes are leftists, but I see no evidence of leftists. Maybe it's because Republicans took right wing ideology and perverted it to their authoritarian theocracy, so that any opposition to that looks like the right thing, even if it's authoritarian communism.

Libertarians do best in small towns, running for non-partisan office. Instead of focusing on Senate races and getting 1.5% (making us look like we're doing political Cosplay instead of actually running for office) State parties need to focus on candidates who can build relationships in small communities, run and win.

Issues Libertarians get reelected on in **small towns and cities** are all the same:

\- Making government more efficient  
\- Improving infrastructure  
\- Opposing tax increases  
\- Introducing more technology and ""customer service"" to government  
\- Supporting small business  
\- Being an ally to diverse communities (race, gender, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, LGBTQ+)

None of this is a poison pill to the average voter. But for some reason, Libertarians would rather lose a National or State election than win a local one. Which leads me to the belief that running in the LP is more about running than it is about winning or governing.

1,1,5648,985,"A case for voting third-party in a two party system, (and why it can be a more powerful vote than a major party vote) First of all I want you to put yourself in the shoes of a political analyst.  Elections swing back and fourth, but most Democrats vote only Democrat or not at all and same with most Republicans.  So how do you capture the voters that make a difference? Capturing swing-voters, centrists, and undecideds is a mixed bag to say the least.  Its hard to generalize all of them in a single model or with a simple strategy.

You can't use polls. Polls are basically crap, as confirmed by the past two elections.  Maybe by some paradigms you can say Biden won by a landslide of Electoral votes, but those margins are too thin in too many states.  He didn't nearly win by the number of points predicted in most polls.

Votes, on the other hand, are concrete.  Votes are action.  They are a measurement of something real.  Everything else is speculation.  If you are analyzing political data to formulate a strategy, there is nothing better than a VOTE. Keep this in mind going forward.  Yes you can get actionable data in other ways, but votes speak loudest.

The current strategy is somewhat serendipitous as it would find both parties working together to an extent.  ""There is an EMERGENCY!!"" they cry.  They then disagree on the reasons, but each has a message that the other guy will make it worse.  This captures centrists based on their lean.  Their candidate doesn't resonate with them at all, but they need to fall in the direction of their major party lean or the country will burn. Maybe circumstances in this particular election made a more compelling argument for this 'emergency' state than previously, but make no mistake, this wins people over under *any* circumstance.  There is always awful thing happening which can be spun one way or another and people will lap it up.

This works and is incredibly convenient for them.  Getting backing from a major party is hugely helpful in getting votes in the primaries and major parties back candidates whose allegiances are in the right places and will work for the collectives goal of that party, which is notoriously less transparent than any party would like you to believe. The distribution efforts of their lip-service never matches the distribution of their efforts for their actual push.  Even the most technically-honest politicians are guilty of this.  This is starting to sound like a conspiracy theory here, but the scary thing here is no conspiring is required.  A group of people with drastically different lifestyles than their constituents is in control of the decision-making, and the things that benefit them collectively have much overlap.  They don't need to ever conspire to work towards the common benefit together.

So how do we break this cycle of having to vote for a slightly-less garbage candidate?  A three party system might help, but what can we do in the current system to force it in the direction of the will of the people rather than the will of the politicians?

The answer is voting third-party.  Remember what I said about the votes?  They are the most concrete information you can feed to politicians.  You actually got off your ass to vote, and when you voted you voted for certain principles, concrete and measurable. If candidates are losing based on a margin of votes taken up by third party candidates they will need to find a way to capture those votes in order to stay in power, and you've communicated exactly which direction they need to drift in order to capture your vote.

**But the third-party candidates have no chance of winning!:**

This is honestly more a feature than a bug in our third-party system.  You don't need to worry about the candidate. They wont win.  This will at least continue to be true for the next 4 years, and then we will have information to see if it will continue for 4 years after.  You don't need to support a pure Libertarian or Green party candidate or ideology. You only need to think the country would be served better if both parties drifted in that direction.

It takes over 40% of the vote for a candidate to win (usually) but it only takes a couple percent for party strategists to take notice of a third party and try to capture it.  In this way a third party vote can be more powerful than a major-party vote. Not only because it is the only way to *really* vote for change, but because of this change in weight.

Voting for a major party is a vote for that candidate and for that party to stay exactly on its current course.  A vote for a third party is a vote for a slight change in direction and has little to do with the actual candidate.  If a major party candidate actually resonates with you then vote for them.  If they don't, **don't settle!** Vote for a third-party that dictates the direction you'd like things to move.  If things have drifted in that direction enough that one of the major parties puts fourth a candidate that resonates with you, then vote for that candidate.

Stop thinking short term, stop thinking about third-parties as an absolute end of the spectrum.  That takes us through the safest path deeper into the collision zone.  Steer away, even if its little bumpier in the short term than moving further in.  Think long-term.  Think about third parties as nudges in a re-direction rather than a position at that absolute.

Feel free to challenge whether it's relevant to our cause, since we're talking about two ruling parties which are both fundamentally authoritarian.*

Having said that, imagine for a moment what the votes would have looked like if then-candidate Joe Biden had come out and said the following two things:

""Having observed Trump's presidency and the actions and tactics of his administration, I have come to a change of heart.  I believe the true and rightful purpose of the right to keep and bear arms is to allow the citizens to meaningfully oppose any state actor that seeks to invalidate their freedoms of democracy, assembly, speech, and other constitutional protections.  I further believe that a ban on modern rifles, which make up a tiny fraction of the firearms used in crime, would invalidate this right, and my administration is committed to opposing a ban on these firearms.""

""Also, I recognize that in our fight against the Coronavirus, we must not lose sight of our constitution.  We will be guided by science wherever this is not in direct conflict with the constraints placed on our government by our constitution, and we will do everything we can to encourage responsible habits during this struggle.  However, we will not support the suspension of the freedom of assembly, and particularly assembly in houses of worship.  Please, wear masks, and please make responsible decisions about attending gatherings that can be supplanted in other ways; but also know that we will not suspend the freedom of assembly or other constitutional freedoms under the auspices of public health.""

Now, I'm not here to argue that these stances would sway a meaningful number of libertarian voters.  However, I can't help but speculate that such compromises in his positions would have swayed many who held their noses and voted for Trump, while likely not diminishing Biden's voter turnout even measurably.

1,3,1485,256,"LP - 2021 Gubernatorial Elections 2021 is a minor gubernatorial election year. Just shy of a year from now, citizens of New Jersey and Virginia will be selecting new governors.

Northam of Virginia (yes, that guy) must vacate his seat since Virginia does not allow anyone to hold the position for consecutive terms. He won in 2017 by a 6 percent margin while the Libertarian candidate got a *solid* 1%, not even bridging the gap.

New Jersey Governor, Phil Murphy, won his seat in 2017 by a 15 percent margin - a complete turnaround from the prior election. I'm going to credit Chris Christie for being so aggressively unlikable. The 2017 LP candidate scored less then a half-percent, nearly beaten by even the Greens. Murphy will run again, so this election is probably more lopsided.

That raises the following questions:

- Does the LP still have ballot access in these states?
- Are they running candidates in 2021?
- Are either of these races worth focusing on?

I personally think that New Jersey is a waste of time right now, but Virginia might be a decent opportunity. Apparently the 2013 LP candidate, Robert Sarvis, earned 6.5% despite being excluded from every debate. Though it may have had something to do with $300,000 in PAC money that his campaign received. He ran most of his campaign through television ads, Perot style.

Since the election is over (hopefully), I’ve been looking for what I should be doing leading up to the 2024 election. Since our state is very red, every election it seems almost pointless to vote either way. I admit that I am left-leaning but from what I have seen I am a lot more morally aligned with the Libertarian party than I am the Democratic Party. I supported Bernie Sanders in this year’s primaries until he dropped out in which case I had to capitulate and support Biden. I have never liked the Democratic Party and I definitely have never liked the Republican Party. Given the fact that my vote almost means absolutely nothing in my state and the fact that I disagree with both parties, I was thinking that I should support a third-party, be it either the Libertarian party or the Green Party. 

I am quite left-leaning,even going as far to describe myself as a libertarian socialist. This is why I supported Bernie because Bernie seemed to have more of a libertarian/anti-government sort of feel to him then the other candidates. I think that if I am to pay taxes then my taxes should go back to things that support me like healthcare, schooling, and infrastructure instead of fueling the military industrial complex. The governments only role should be to serve its citizens, NOT the other way around. I am also concerned with the oppression that companies can cause people and it is sometimes even as bad as that of government oppression, such as how the insurance industry screws over average working Joe’s. 

Despite all of this I am pro gun and relatively anti-government. I support legalization of illicit substances. I believe that the “defund the police” movement inherently has libertarian leanings. Scrolling through this SubReddit some I can tell that you all aren’t like the shells in the republican party who pretend to be anti-government but then turn around and oppress the citizens of our country and countries abroad.

The reason that I might choose the Libertarian party over the Green party is the fact that the Green party would basically be impossible to campaign for in this state that is so right leaning, but I feel that if I campaign for the Libertarian party I might be able to get sympathy from some of those right wing voters and be able to turn their vote for good.

But the bottom line is what will all of this do? I know there are some perks for the party if we get a certain amount of votes but I don’t know exactly about that and I would ask that someone here please inform me.

From what I seen this is probably the only political sub Reddit that isn’t a complete circle jerk, so I’m sure there will be tons of fruitful conversation in the comments I look forward to talking to you.

1,1,2359,404,"The three levels of the Libertarian Party I’ve seen a few confused opinions on the Libertarian Party based on mistaken beliefs on how the Libertarian Party operates in the US. Some of this is based on election law and practices that have been created over time. The first thing is that the Libertarian Party is not just the National Party. The Libertarian Party operates on the National, State, and County level. In some States there might even be additional organizational levels.

The National LP concentrates on ballot access and running National candidates. They also give some resources to other races depending on what resources are available and how that race might impact ballot access for a state or garner National attention.

Your State LP concentrates on maintaining ballot access within your State and running State wide candidates. They will also give some support to other local candidates depending on what volunteers and resources are available. 

Your County LP concentrates on local candidates, activism, and what ever priorities they might be able to handle locally. This is the grass roots level.

While Counties are affiliates of their State LP and the State LP is an affiliate of National things operate on a very bottom up representative structure as opposed to a top down structure. This means new members and volunteers can jump in and work and/or donate to whatever level they prefer. This also means that National is limited on what they can dictate to happen at the other levels. Everyone has their  own leadership structure and finances.

What I can say for those that want to see more work at the State and County level is, you can easily start the change you want to see. Presidential election years are typically a boon to State and County LP organizations bringing in a flood of donations of time and money. In the off years when local and state elections occur and when those organizations need the time and volunteers the most, there is typically a drop off. Be the change you want to see and get involved and/or donate to your local and State LP.

I think it’s important to note that trump’s presidency was hardly defined by his policies. They were hardly why his supporters were there and they were hardly what his detractors detested. This is why when his promises didn’t come to fruition, his supporters didn’t waver. It was the spirit of the promises, the audacity of his words, and the message it sent. Trump was the great tell-off. 

There is a citizen in America who was average just 10 years ago, who has been made to feel like an unwelcome outsider in his own country. One who has been labelled an extremist, and all the other branding words used by the machine to express distaste for those not of sanctioned opinion. 

There is a citizen in America who fears for their job, only because he holds what used to be just a few years ago a normal opinion. Any rational person could reasonably agree with him, or at least acknowledge the merits. He knows that if the corporatist establishment got its way, he would be banned from social media, shamed by his friends and family, excluded from payment processors, fired from his job, stripped of his means of self defence, silenced, exiled, and eventually prosecuted. There are people who want to take his kids away from him because he doesn’t teach them the radical ideology that is Endorsed. 

This sentiment is no longer able to be brushed off as paranoia or his imagination. He sees it when he watches the news, he sees it on every social media, he puts up with it at his job, he is taught it in college, (and his kids are taught it long before then), he is shown it in every movie, told it by every celebrity, and reminded of it during every sporting event. There is no respite from the feeling of complete loathing that the coastal elites have for him. 

He isn’t gone, but he is withdrawn. Polite Society has made it clear there is no place for him; he’s no better than any of the other people they despise. A group which includes actual racists, rapists, violent criminals, but also anyone else who dissents. 

Be warned and take heed. If you treat +70 million people exactly the same as Hitler, he might end up siding with Hitler just to get back at you. Because he knows that it wasn’t Trump they hated. He knows it was himself all along.",2

1,30,3664,634,"THE BURNING HOUSE ANALOGY IS BS, AND HERE IS WHY... Lmfao. It’s hilarious to me that people still spread around this logically flawed argument about the burning house analogy.

In case you don’t know, the burning house analogy is the justification for BLM.

Just skimming through it, the argument starts with there being black houses and white houses basically residing within the same neighborhood. The argument begins with the black houses being on fire and the white houses not being on fire; the fire department is called and rushes to the scene to extinguish the flames. Upon arriving, the firefighters say “we need to allocate the same amount of water to every white house that we do to every black house”. That’s how they view ALM. If the firefighters say “all houses matter”, and then proceed to ration the water evenly to all houses when only the black ones are burning, the black houses will burn down. Instead, the water given to the white houses could have been given to the black houses and they would have been saved.

TLDR: when firefighters go to put out a house fire, they don’t spray every house because “all lives matter”, they spray only black houses because at threat moment, they are the ones in fire so they are the ones that need the attention.

Well, that’s a pretty sound argument!... NOT!!!

First off, my own rationale aside, anyone who knows anything about firefighting KNOWS that FIREFIGHTERS REGULARLY ALLOCATE WATER TO SURROUNDING HOUSES TO AVOID THEM CATCHING FIRE FROM FALLING DEBRIS. So your argument just doesn’t make sense. The whole point you make is about firefighters supposedly only focusing on burning houses when that isn’t even what they do! They do preemptive spraying of nearby houses.

That point aside, I will now get into the real meat of my counter argument.

THE WHOLE BURNING HOUSE ANALOGY ASSUMES THAT ONLY THE BLACK HOUSES ARE BURNING; CONNECTING THIS BACK TO THE REAL-WORLD POINT, THE BURNING HOUSE ANALOGY INHERENTLY CLAIMS THAT NO WHITE PEOPLE GET ABUSED BY COPS, NO WHITE PEOPLE FACE UNFAIR TREATMENT BY THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND NO WHITE PEOPLE GET FUCKED BY THE SYSTEM.

Within the burning house analogy, the fire basically represents oppression of some sort. So if we are being accurate, the white houses are burning too, not just the black houses.

NOW, you COULD claim that the black houses have bigger flames, or is more engulfed, or is closer to collapsing. Maybe the white houses have some little campfire-sized fires inside of them starting, and maybe the black houses are just engulfed. Does that mean that the firefighters are going to put all of their attention toward the more burn-y house and let the white house reach the point of the black house and just burn down? Fuck no. They will give both houses the attention their respective fires deserve.

Now, I know what your argument is about to be: this is all in regards to police profiling and abusing black people on the basis of their race. White people are not targeted for their race and thus the white house should not be burning at all!

Fair point!... NOT!!!

The whole point of BLM is to get substantial change in policing to avoid abuses of power from police officers. If your end goal was to end shady practices from law enforcement, your best bet would be to INCLUDE EVERYBODY. What better way to sell to a white person that cops need to be trained better than to show them someone they can relate to being victimized? Instead, the whole movement says “fuck You” to white people, Hispanic people, Asian people, native Americans, etc, and downplay the fact that they all are at risk of shady treatment too— even if it is less likely!",2

1,0,3873,668,"My Rough Thoughts on a Better Political System I have been giving some thought to an alternative political system, and I thought I would post my thoughts so they may be critiqued by the community as a kind of fun political system thought experiment. With how close the last United States presidential election was, and with how divided it has made the United States, I have come to the conclusion that the President of the United States essentially only truly represents one half of the voting population, leaving the other half, and those who cannot vote or do not vote unrepresented. Due to this, I have given some thought to a possible remedy. This is by no means a completed system, more of just an abstract rough draft. Please keep in mind that this view is based on the current political situation in the United States, and does not account for a “libertarian” view of political stances. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Government would do away with the President, and the Senate, leaving only the House of Representatives as the sole governing authority. Using the United States as the example, each state would be divided into three “equal” parts or “districts” (north, middle, south / west, middle, east), and each district would elect one Representative each, for a total of 150 members of the House of Representatives. These Representatives would serve six year terms, with a maximum of five terms per person. This would eliminate the entire country fighting over which one person would hold an elected position, and have that attention given towards who is going to be selected to represent them and their district. Currently, in the United States, people pay way more attention to who is elected President, then who is elected for the Senate and the House. 

&amp;#x200B;

To qualify to be a candidate up for election to the House of Representatives, a person would have to be at least thirty years of age, a citizen for at least ten years, own land in the district of representation, and to have not been found guilty of any crimes involving dishonesty, theft, fraud, forgery, force, or aggression (the crimes would need to be more specific, but that’s the gist of it). I feel like thirty years of age is long enough to give someone enough life experience to be a leader capable of sound judgement. That would give the average individual a good balance of educational years as well as working years to gain these experiences from. The citizenship requirement will give a pathway for immigrants to become leaders of the country, while also giving them enough life experience as a citizen to become a good leader of that country. Please don’t dig too far into this statement, because there isn’t any intent to portray immigrants as being unable to naturally be good leaders. I’m only saying that, in my opinion, local culture counts to some extent. When it comes to land ownership, I’m sure many will disagree, but I feel like having a hard asset such as land within your area of representation gives one enough “skin in the game” to encourage the promotion of healthy policies for a representative’s area of representation. A way of helping keep them honest, if you will. Lastly, I think the criminal element pretty much speaks for itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

My final thought to this deals in the area of legislation. To pass legislation, I truly feel like there should be a requirement for a two-thirds majority to be in favor of said legislation in order for it to be passed. To put it bluntly, this would help ensure that the legislation is actually good, and needed. There needs to be a buffer to force the House of Representatives to work with one another, to focus on things that are really needed and are a priority, and help keep out the bullshit. Anyways, I look forward to hearing any feedback on my little thought experiment. Have a good night everyone. :)",2

How there were still plenty of people who didn't vote and how republicans failed to appeal to you. How voting third way isn't a wasted vote, etc.

Look, I know it's well intentioned and I'm sure there are plenty of republicans both on Reddit and in real life who do absolutely blame you for ""losing them the vote"" and who hate your guts right now. And you and I know that's not the case.

Those posts I called out are true. You didn't lose them the vote. Republicans didn't appeal to you and some people still didn't vote. But making endless posts actively defending yourselves sure as hell makes it seem like you feel guilty about it. 

""It's not my fault, look, here are the issues!""

No. 

Stop defending yourself for them losing. It's not your responsibility for their political party not being elected. It's their job to do so, and you need to stop taking blame for that or it just makes it seem like you feel guilty and regret your vote.

Stop making excuses for why you voted the way you did and stand your ground. Call them out directly if someone confronts you. ""Why didn't you do better?"" Then maybe they'll finally start taking you seriously.

As for why I'm saying ""you"" instead of ""us"" - I'm not a US citizen so consider this a foreign libertarian's perspective.",2

I understand the whole concept of limiting government to maximize personal liberty, but surely there’s a distinction somewhere in there? For example, obviously some laws (i.e. those encoded in the Constitution) are in place to ensure personal liberties.

Also, wouldn’t efforts to promote equal opportunity (*not* equal outcome) be considered a way of ensuring personal liberties for all? Maybe an argument could be made that having a large segment of the population being born with substantially fewer privileges and options is equivalent to them having fewer liberties.

Furthermore, would libertarians like to see Federal Government cut and replaced by local or State Government? Or is the ideology more along the lines that less government will always be better?

1,27,2049,353,"Yes, it is enough to be passively not racist Jo.... TLDR at bottom

The non-aggression principle tells us that “yes, it is enough to be not racist”.  Hell, to take it a step further, it’s ok to be racist as long as you don’t infringe on the rights of others. You probably won’t make a lot of friends, (nor should you) but your feelings and beliefs are no one’s business but your own - provided you don’t move into the place of doing harm. 

This woke SJW BS and pandering is NEVER going to reach anyone that would even consider voting anything but Democrat anyway. What a perfect opportunity missed to call out Biden and Harris on their hypocrisy and talk about their atrocious record on criminal justice. Or how about talking about how the lockdowns are disproportionately hurting minorities?  Ending the drug war is only scratching the surface of differentiation between the two major parties and the LP, and its old news.  Stop with only spouting off the pre-approved talking points, and let’s not be afraid to make people a little uncomfortable.  For example, it’s not a given that the government should guarantee health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions.  Did Jo ever bring that up? (I truly don’t know the answer to that - kudos if she did)

And before anyone goes down the “just because you support BLM the movement doesn’t mean you support the organization” path, spare me. The names, logos, marketing, key players, etc are the same. That’s not an accident, Commingling between the two is intentional, and it’s having its desired effect, If they want to prove that point wrong, either the organization or the movement should alter their name. (If I started a non-profit called the “MAGA Foundation” to support farmers, but tried to claim I was unrelated to Trumpism, how much luck do you think I’d have?”

TLDR: Yes, being not racist is more than enough.  Woke SJW positioning has never and will never draw people to anyone besides the Dems. Libertarianism has plenty to offer minorities and we need to start pointing that out.",2

Of course that's one of the things I liked about him, but really, it didn't do him any favors. 

Second.. Everybody knows there's been election fraud. The liberals hate Trump so much they don't even care that it erodes the Republic. The have the media and big tech on their side because they are easy to control.. sheep. Nobody can do what truly needs to be done, and it's not a problem with an easy solution. What truly needs to be done would involve death and destruction of people, entities, and systems. The typical American family can't afford to endanger themselves for it, and the powers that be know this. They will slowly gain control of us all, with 70 million happily going along, and the other half trying their best to deal with it by the rules. The colors of our flag are fading with every rigged election. We are basically fucked by big brother, big tech, and tiny dick liberals. Remember that when the dollar gets replaced, pharmecuticals are forced on your family, and tracking is embedded in more than your phones. Comfort is a horrible drug, and they sell it by the TON.

Third.. Joe Biden will be President, life will go on, and we will adapt with dignity instead of crying in the streets and on social media for years. We will be smart, keep our eyes on the local and state level politics (because that shit matters more than President), and vote for what best represents our values. In four years, when Biden has been ejected from politics for being mentally unfit or whatever excuse they come up with, we'll have to battle the fraud all over again. I wouldn't put it past the left to take out Biden! Maybe they'll hire Killary. Don't you find it preposterous that she evaded prison despite being a proven treasonous bitch that would have been hanged from the highest tree 200 years ago? Never forget all of the people that were found dead over the past several years. I know one thing.. when Obama, Hillary, and Biden are dead, I'll have to whip out my big dick and take a piss on their graves in honor of them.

The fact is.. the whole system is rigged and fucked. The current system won't even let the Libertarian candidate debate on the stage much less have any chance at securing a nomination. How fucked is that really? The rules need to be changed there.

70 million people hate Trump and his big mouth. They are backed buy the media and big tech. The media and big tech control much of your lives even if you don't know it. And they will lie, cheat, and steal to maintain their positions of power. Don't ever forget 2020. Where Convid was engineered specifically to endanger America and affect the election, Mass voter fraud was caught in several stated by Project Veritas and others, Social media and big tech censored and silenced our voices, and liberals everwhere voted not for what's good for the Republic and the people, but for their hurt feelings.

In case you don't know, gerrymandering is the practice of redrawing voting districts to give one party an advantage over the other. Let's say your state has 5 districts and 60% of voters favor your rival party, you could always concede and allow 3 of those districts to go over and keep 2 yourself, OR you could get super creative and showcase your art skills by redrawing the district lines to flip the results and end up with 3 or maybe even 4 for yourself, with the added bonus of now one of those districts looks like a flamingo jerking off a rhinoceros.

With the election going on and me in college, I am -- pardon my French -- just fucking sick of people. I try to keep the perspective that there are smart and well-intentioned people with every kind of political/social/economic leanings. However, in-person, online, and in classes, I cannot help but feel like most people are either willfully blind or indoctrinated to the point of no return (r/iamverysmart).

I'm taking a political economics class, and it seriously feels like it is economics for people who refuse to believe in economic (looking at you, political scientists). Every week, it's Keynesianism this, Keynesianism that, and constant ridiculing of austerity and liberalism. Republicans and Democrats are basically the same shit colored differently. Most of my peers really seem like NPCs repeating everything the media/Democrats say. Every subreddit, user, etc., on the internet is fucking filled with the stupid election now.

1,3,2010,351,"Would it be better to join the GOP? I’ve been a member of the LP for years. 

I voted for every LP candidate on my ballot including Jo.

I donated to a number of candidates as well, including Ricky Harrington, Donald Rainwater, and Jo.

I hate that we have a 2 party system, and wish we had an alternative to FPTP like ranked choice voting or some version of proportional representation.

That being said, I’m starting to re-think the idea that most viable path to liberty is with the LP.

So, here’s the statistic that has me questioning things:

The LP is celebrating the election of Marshall Burt to the Wyoming legislature. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s great as well. But this is only the 5th time, in almost 50 years of the LP’s existence, that an LP candidate has been elected to a state legislature. 

So, with that in mind, I see Young Americans for Liberty bragging on social media that in the last 2 years alone, 56 candidates that YAL endorsed and campaigned for won state offices. All Republicans. 

So, in other words, YAL working within the GOP has performed 10x better than the LP in 1/25th of the time. 

Granted, a lot of these candidates are moderate libertarians or “conservatarians” etc., definitely no AnCaps. But nonetheless when I check out their campaign materials or bills they’ve written I see everything from ending civil asset forfeiture to abolishing state income/property taxes to legalizing psychedelics. 

I really hate so many of the factions of the GOP, from the religious right to the Neocon war hawks, to the new populists. But when the only politicians even libertarian-leaning in congress are GOP, and when I see libertarian or libertarian leaning republicans elected to statehouses at a far greater rate than LP candidates, I can’t help but wonder if my resources would be better spent elsewhere.

What am I missing, and why should I stick with the LP?

TLDR More libertarian types seem to be elected via the GOP than the LP. So wouldn't it be better to join the GOP?",2

However, I have a very large concern that I see consistently shoved under the rug by libertarians...almost as a joke.

In a conceptualized more libertarian world, where the federal government’s power has been reduced and the general market made freer, what is to keep corporations from abusing the people who work for them at the lowest level? The common, regular worker who gets paid next to nothing, received no benefits, and has to work 60-70 hours a week to survive. In a system that is already run into the ground in every sense by the wealthy turning America into a cycle of feeding themselves and their descendants more and more money, how does simply giving them even more autonomy prevent the upper class from fucking everyone else.

What will prevent the top of society from doing everything they can to hoard the wealth at the very top? What measures does the Libertarian Party recommend by a smaller government that prevents minimum wage and lower class workers from being abused and prevented from class mobility?
